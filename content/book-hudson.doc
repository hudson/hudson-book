[[chapter-introduction]]
== Introducing Hudson

What is Hudson?

Hudson is a powerful and widely used open source continuous
integration server providing development teams with a reliable way to
monitor changes in source control and trigger a variety of builds.
Hudson excels at integrating with almost every tool you can think of:
from Maven, to Ant, to Gradle, to simple bash scripts for builds and
SMS, IRC, and Skype for notifications.

In addition to providing a platform for continuous integration builds,
Hudson can also be extended to support software releases,
documentation, monitoring, and a number of use cases secondary to
continuous integration.  In short, if you can think it, Hudson can do
it.  From automating system administration tasks with Puppet and
verifying infrastructure setup with Cucumber, to building and testing
PHP code, to simply building Enterprise Java applications - Hudson
stands ready to help.

=== Continuous Integration

Martin Fowler and Kent Beck are largely credited with the first use of
the term "Continuous Integration" as applied to software development
with Beck's seminal 1999 book _Extreme Programming Explained_ being
the first published work touching upon the idea of creating systems to
continuously build and test systems in response to changes in source
control.  In the decade since this concept was introduced, continuous
integration is now an established, standard practice used across an
entire industry.

NOTE: Beck, Kent (1999). Extreme Programming Explained. ISBN
0-201-61641-6.

The idea, put simply, is that software development efforts are much
easier to manage when test failures and other bugs can be identified
closer to the time they were introduced into a complex system.  Let's
examine the differences between a development effort using a
Continuous Integration server, and a development effort not using
Continuous Integration.

==== A Hypothetical Development Team

Consider a hypothetical group of 20-30 developers working on a large
enterprise application.

This development team consists of 20-30 developers divided into groups
of 5-12 developers working on focused features and components in a
larger system.  One group focuses on the database and a collection of
APIs shared by all other groups, one group focuses on a complex
front-end web application, and another group focuses on back-end
systems such as billing and inventory which interface with a large
Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).

In this environment the business drives a number of overlapping
development schedules.  The web application team tends to work on two
week development schedules, and the back-end group performs releases
in response to changes in the ESB.  Any given month resemble a highly
choreographed sequence of code freezes, development sprints, and
products releases with little room for error and inefficiency.

In summary, these 20-30 developers are under constant pressure to
deliver, and the technical managers are tasked with orchestrating the
efforts of these various teams to deploy code to production on a
regular schedule.  This is what the enterprise feels like in 2011:
it's very busy, and if you happen to find a bit of free time there is
always someone who can create a new requirement.

==== Without Continuous Integration

Without Continuous Integration the various teams have to factor in
"integration time" into the schedule.  Unit tests might be run by
individual developers, but integration tests are only executed when
the system is ready to be deployed.  There's nothing automatic about
the process, and, very often only a handful of developers have the
appropriate environment to build and deploy to production.

Each team, each group is responsible for testing the larger system and
making sure that their changes don't interfere with another group's
changes.  One week before a release, everything stops so that a single
"release manager" can build a canonical build on a single build
machine and deploy this build to a testing environment.

Each time one group needs to deploy a specific part of the system,
every group needs to stop, synchronize, and test.  If the web
application group needs to deploy to production, all of the other
groups need to synchronize with that group and make sure that all of
the tests pass during a build.

This constant need to stop, integrate, and verify introduces a
synthetic limit to the scale of development.  As development teams
scale and grow larger, and as systems become increasingly complex and
intertwined your team spends more time on integration
and testing.

Without continuous integration, developing modern applications is
practically impossible without dramatic inefficiency.  There is too
much unproductive down-time, and far too much waste.  The development
group described above would be hard pressed to release anything more
than a global update once a month.

==== With Continuous Integration

With Continuous Integration, the system completes a build, test,
deploy, and integration in response to every single commit.  If a
developer in the web application group checks in code at 2 AM, Hudson
kicks off a build, runs unit tests, deploys the code to a new server,
and performs a set of integration tests.  If this build fails or the
tests encounter an unexpected condition, everyone is notified of this
failure.

With continuous integration, no one needs to drop everything and run a
release build, these builds are generated every single day, and in the
most mature environments, a fully tested and verified system can be
deployed to production at any time.  In other words, when you automate
build, test, and verify using a tool like Hudson you can continue
developing your applications without having to wait (or synchronize)
on some manual build, test, verify process.

Making these processes automatic has another important side-effect, it
makes the development process more scale-able.  When your teams don't
have to stop to actively test and collaborate with one another, it is
much easier to add additional developers to a project.  Without
continuous integration you have to stop and synchronize release
schedules.  With continuous integration you reduce the risk associated
with a particular software development cycle.

=== Minimizing Technical Debt

Another way to think about Hudson is in terms of technical debt.  

When you amass "technical debt" you are making a decision that yields
a short-term benefit while creating a problem to be solved in the
future.  If you've developed code under strict time lines, technical
debt is nothing new to you.  Every system has some form of technical
debt.  If you've ever sacrificed quality for the expedient solution,
you've experienced technical debt: "the code had to be deployed
tomorrow and the deadline was fast approaching".

From the perspective of builds and tests, it is much easier to develop
a system without having to worry about unit tests and integration
tests.  You could speed up implementation time for a feature by just
skipping the tests, but you'll eventually pay for this approach
ten-fold in the form of bug fixes.

Continuous integration along with a commitment to test-driven
development helps minimize your exposure to risky technical debt.
Because you are running the unit and integration tests every few
minutes, you don't have the opportunity to let problems sit and fester
unaddressed.  When you develop without continuous integration, you are
amassing the potential for technical debt.  You can choose to fix bugs
as they are introduced, minimizing both the scope and severity of
defects by catching them early, or you can develop for weeks and run
tests only at the end of the development cycle.

While you might only deploy to production once a month, your Hudson
installation deploys once a commit, and when you are dealing with
increasingly complex systems this granularity makes sure that any
glaring quality detours are confined to a single commit.

=== Push it to Production with Hudson

The infrastructure that powers applications has grown more and more
complex over time.  The web application that ran on a production
network of 10 hefty Unix machines in 1999 has evolved into an
architecture that can potentially span hundreds (or thousands) of
nodes on a computing grid.  Companies like Apple and Oracle are
deploying infrastructure on a massive scale compared to where the
industry was operating just a few years ago.  This movement toward
Cloud-based deployments and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) has meant
that infrastructure is now more likely to be compiled and deployed on
an as-needed basis.

Organizations are using tools like Hudson to setup production
deployments and automate the management of cloud-based infrastructure.
This carries the idea of Continuous Integration forward into the realm
of Continuous Deployment.  While the idea may sound risky if you work
in a relatively slow-moving industry, social networks like Facebook
and social media services such as Flickr have been building complex
developer/operations (devops) systems that allow them to deploy code
to production multiple times a day.

While this emerging trend is still confined to the largest
deployments, the idea of connecting your Continuous Integration server
directly to your production systems is gaining support.  Hudson can be
a critical part of automating these approaches to continuous
deployment.  Proven integration with tools like Puppet and Cucumber
allow innovative devops staff to take continuous integration in some
surprising directions.

=== General Purpose Scheduler

Hudson can also be viewed as a general purpose scheduler, a
replacement for cron or Quartz in your production network.  While
Hudson is generally viewed as development infrastructure, a class of
infrastructure usually considered separate from the rarefied world of
production, there's nothing stopping you from using Hudson as a
general purpose scheduler or server running within a production network.

If you have a requirement for scheduled services or if you need to
perform a set of on-demand jobs in a production network, install
Hudson and you've gained a friendly interface and a tool that can
integrate with anything in the world.  There's nothing stopping you
from using Hudson in production.

[[intro-sect-community]]
=== The Hudson Community at Eclipse

Hudson has an evolving community of developers and organizations
interested in taking Hudson to the next level of stability and
reliability.  Following the creation of the Jenkins fork in early
2011, several members of the community decided to commit themselves to
reconstituting the Hudson community and moving the project to the
Eclipse Foundation.  This move promises to create a more stable
approach to open source governance while creating a level playing
field for interested individuals and organizations.

Throughout its history the Hudson project lacked a formal structure
and avoided process.  Grown from a pet project, the governance of
Hudson was ad-hoc.  While this ad-hoc approach scaled for a few years,
as more organizations decided to participate and contribute to the
project the Hudson community identified a need for more formal
procedures on issues such as release management, code provenance, and
general technical direction.  It is now the desire of the Hudson
project to move toward a more formal process and structure with the
end-goal of creating a healthy, open environment with well-defined
rules, as well as a development process and release processes for
building a high-quality and reliable continuous integration server.

Eclipse has a history of encouraging healthy environments for open
source projects.  It is an organization supported and respected by
millions of end-users, thousands of contributors, and hundreds of
active companies. In addition to being a great home for the Hudson
project, Eclipse is also an important user of the software.  Hudson
has become an integral part of the development infrastructure at
Eclipse, and the requirements of the Eclipse Foundation mirror the
requirements of some of the largest enterprises in the world.

[[intro-sect-project]]
=== The Hudson Project

The main source of information about Hudson is the web site hosted at
http://hudson-ci.org[http://hudson-ci.org].  This site contains links
to resources like a Wiki, an issue tracker, a few mailing lists, the
source code and more.  If you are looking for download Hudson or learn
about participating in the, you can start with the Hudson project's
web site.

At the time this document was developed, the Hudson project at Eclipse
was focused on the following tasks:

* Improving the core of Hudson by bolstering the test harnesses,

* Creating a new performance harnesses allowing for more detailed
  performance assessment and testing.

* Developing a fully automated test and release infrastructure

Some of the larger, medium-term goals of the Hudson project are:

* *Improving stability* - The Eclipse project is investing in QA
  efforts to certify Eclipse to run on a set of standard platforms.
  Improving the reliability and stability of Hudson will enable more
  predictable behavior for end-users and also enable an ecosystem of
  interested third-party providers of Hudson support services.

* *Improving performance* - The project is focused on addressing
  performance, especially for organizations using Hudson to support
  large numbers of projects.

* *Improving Maven 3.x integration* - Sonatype has contributed a
  completely reworked Maven 3 plugin which takes advantage of changes
  to Maven 3 which were made to increase the ease with which Maven
  could be integrate in IDEs such as Eclipse and CI servers such as
  Hudson.

* *Improve the UI* - Prior to the migration to the Eclipse Foundation,
  the Hudson project had standardized on Jelly as a UI technology.
  The Hudson is currently focused on moving the UI system way from
  Jelly and toward a more modern approach to creating a solid,
  reactive user interface for Hudson.

* *Closer Integration for Core Plugins* - One of the first steps of
  the Hudson project during the transition to Eclipse was to define a
  tiered set of Hudson plugins and establish a level of commitment and
  support to the most widely used plugins.  It is the intention of the
  Eclipse project to increase the level of support and integration for
  these core plugins.

* *A standard OSGi Runtime Model based on Eclipse Equinox* - Hudson's
  legacy architecture was full of issues arising from the lack of a
  unified architecture.  The Hudson project is work to move Hudson
  toward an OSGi model based on Eclipse Equinox.  This will not only
  lead to a more stable CI server, it will make it easier to integrate
  and embed Hudson in systems like the Eclipse IDE and other,
  widely-used OSGi containers.

* *Support the a standard component model using JSR 330* - Early
  efforts were made to move the plugin API toward an approach
  compatible with JSR 330.  This effort not only makes it easier to
  write and test Hudson plugins, it also aligns Hudson will the way
  that Java is developed in 2011 using frameworks and libraries such
  as Google Guice and VMWare's Spring Framework.

* *Standard web services using JAXRS* - Many of the plugins and core
  systems in Hudson are being migrated to a system that presents UI
  services as a collection of REST services.  This foundational effort
  will set the stage for Hudson to move toward a richer, more reactive
  UI architecture possibly involving a migration to a SOFEA approach
  to user interface.

* *Backwards Compatibility* - Despite this list of ideas and plans,
  the Hudson community is also focused on supporting existing plugins
  and Hudson APIs.

[[intro-sect-license]]
=== Hudson's License

As Hudson has completed the transition to the Eclipse Foundation, the
core of Hudson is covered by the
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html[Eclipse Public License
version 1.0].  The Open Source Initiative categorizes the Eclipse
Public License as a "popular and widely used license with a strong
community".  The EPL is a limited copy-left license designed to be a
"business-friendly" alternative to the GPL.  For more information
about the Eclipse Public License, see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eclipse_Public_License

If you have any questions about the Eclipse Public License, the
Eclipse Foundation also maintains a
http://www.eclipse.org/legal/eplfaq.php[helpful FAQ] about the
license.  A big reason for the move to the Eclipse Foundation was to
make sure that the project was on solid ground for licensing issues.
Eclipse takes intellectual property and code provenance very seriously
and maintains a strict contribution review process to make sure that
every project release complies with a set of licensing standards.  If
you download it from Eclipse, if it is stored in Eclipse's source
control systems, it is released under the EPL.

NOTE: While the core of Hudson is licensed under the EPL, Hudson is a
container for running various Hudson Plugins.  These plugins may be
covered by a variety of licenses, and if you are redistributing Hudson
along with a set of 3rd party plugins, you should consult each
individual plugin project to find a specific license.

[[chapter-install]]
== Installing and Running Hudson

Hudson has a reputation for being both easy to install and very
adaptable to running in a variety of environments.  You can run Hudson
as a stand-alone web application, or you can run Hudson within an
existing servlet container.  The Hudson project also maintains
OS-specific packages for Redhat, Debian, Ubuntu, and other Linux
distributions which make installing Hudson on these platforms almost
effortless.

The following sections detail the installation process for
Hudson. There are two different approaches to installing Hudson:

WAR File::

  The Hudson web site provides a Java web archive file (WAR) for
  download. This file can either be started directly or used in an
  existing Java servlet container or application server.

Native Package::

  Besides the web archive you can download packages for Hudson
  suitable for the use with the native package management systems on
  Ubuntu/Debian, Oracle Linux, Redhat/Fedora/CentOS and openSUSE.

It is a best practice to install Hudson as a service automatically
started when an operating system boots.  On a Windows machine this can
be as straightforward as configuring a new Windows Service, and on a
Linux machine this is as easy as dropping the appropriate script in
'/etc/init.d'.  The following sections outline the process for
configuring Hudson as a service on various operating systems.

[[section-install-prerequisites]]
=== Prerequisites

While Hudson can run on a variety of machines under an almost infinite
combination of JVMs, Operating System, and infrastructure.  The Hudson
project is targeting a set of standard operating systems and Java
versions.  This section outlines some of the expectations - the
preconditions that are necessary to install and run a Hudson server.

==== Software Prerequisites

Hudson only has one prerequisite, a Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
compatible with Java 6 or higher.  Hudson is most often run with the
JRE that is bundled with a Java Development Kit (JDK) installation. We
recommend using the latest version of the JDK/JRE Java 6.  If you are
running on a modern Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, it is often
possible to install the OpenJDK 6 project using a tool like apt-get
(or yum on a Redhat distribution).

Download Oracle Java 6 JDK::

  The latest version of Oracle's JDK 6 is the officially supported
  runtime. To download the latest release of the Oracle JDK, go to the
  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java
  JDK 6 Download Page], and download the latest Java 6 JDK.

Installing OpenJDK 6 on Linux::

  OpenJDK packages are available in both RPM and DEB format which
  should cover most Linux distributions.  To install the OpenJDK 6 on
  your Linux machine, following the instruction on
  http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html[this page].

[[section-install-war]]
==== Hardware Prerequisites

As there is such a wide variety of Hudson deployments, from the Hudson
server that runs a single project once every few days, to the Hudson
server which serves as a master orchestrator of a hundred or more
nodes in a massively distributed build grid, it is impossible to
predict and recommend the necessary CPU power and disk space your
particular installation will demand.  Your own builds and your own
systems will often dictate the specific hardware and network
requirements for your Hudson instance.

What this section can do is provide a few recommendations that will
help size and configure your infrastructure:

Network::

  If your Hudson server is very active you should make sure that there
  is sufficient bandwidth and low latency between your Hudson server
  and your source control system.  Hudson is configured to
  periodically test the source control system and look for changes.
  In general, the critical components of your development
  infrastructure should be colocated with one another.  Your CI server
  should be next to your SCM server.  If your Hudson server is
  configured to automatically publish build artifacts to a repository
  manager, you should also make sure that the network connection
  between these two machines can support the expected level of
  activity.

CPU:: 

  In the absence of build activity, Hudson doesn't consume very much
  in the way of CPU power.  You can let Hudson run in the background,
  waiting for a build to trigger without having to worry about
  consuming more than a few processor cycles.  With build activity,
  you should take the CPU requirements of your own development
  workstation and use that as a baseline for your Hudson server.
  Multiply the power you use as a single developer by the number of
  concurrent builds your Hudson server needs to handle.  In general a
  two or four processor build machine with a powerful processors is a
  good starting point for a medium-sized workgroup of 5-10 developers.

Memory::

  Compilers can often eat massive amounts of RAM.  As with CPU
  configuration, take your own development workstation as a baseline
  and try to multiple that requirement by the number of expected
  concurrent builds.  If your local build can easily run with 2 GB of
  RAM and you expect three concurrent build threads at any given time,
  then make sure that your Hudson instance can consume 6 GB of RAM on
  a server.  You'll have to use your own builds as a guide, but 4-8 GB
  of RAM should be adequate for a medium-sized workgroup.

I/O::

  As with Memory requirements, builds, compilers, and tools like Maven
  and Ant tend to make disk drives go berserk with activity.  If your
  builds are particularly I/O intensive, you are going to want to make
  sure that Hudson has sufficient local storage (or high-speed SAN
  storage).  If you try to run a massive build job using an NFS mount
  to store output you are likely to see unacceptable build
  performance.  Don't "skimp" on hard drive quality or available
  storage space.  I/O is often the primary gating factor in a large
  enterprise-class builds.  Builds eat I/O.

Storage::

  You should be able to get off the ground with 5-10 GB, but once you
  start building your projects, you are going to want to preserve some
  build history.  This build history can provide invaluable insight
  into the trends surrounding a particular build.  If you were able to
  look at your project's build history over a few weeks, you might
  notice that one developer in particular continues to break the build
  for your team.  Alternatively, you can also configure Hudson to keep
  track of important metrics and trends such as test failures over
  time.

If you think that keeping build history around is important, you
should configure Hudson with an appropriate amount of disk space.  What
this number is is heavily dependent on the size of your projects and
the size of the generated binary artifacts.  Larger projects with tens
of thousands of lines of code can often get by with 60-100 GB, but the
largest Hudson installations can easily reach a TB or more depending
on the activity in a given development group.

Again, these recommendations come with a caveat: the authors of this
document are not familiar with your application's build.  If your
tests generate a huge amount of I/O activity or if your builds are
particularly difficult to compile, you should use your best judgment.
A good rule of thumb with Hudson deployments is to make sure that your
Hudson server can satisfy a reasonable number of concurrent builds.
Should it be able to run two builds in parallel?  How about ten?  This
all depends on the size of your development and the frequency with
which code changes are committed to source control.

WARNING: Continuous Integration servers drive quality, and if they are
seriously under-powered they tend not to work.  That tiny afterthought
of a machine that management could spare for Hudson may end up taking
several hours to run a build that takes minutes on your workstation.
If software is something you produce, and if you value quality, you
need to run a machine that will be able to keep up with your
developers.  If you treat the hardware running your CI system as an
afterthought, it you can't afford to invest in the necessary hardware,
don't be surprised if your quality, morale, and productivity take a
nose dive.

=== Installing Hudson with the WAR File Distribution

The WAR file available for download on the Hudson web site is an
executable WAR that has a servlet container embedded within it.  Once
downloaded and copied to the desired directory, you can start Hudson
with the following command:

----
 java -jar hudson.war
----

TIP: That's it.  The Hudson WAR ships with everything it needs to
start itself.

This will start the servlet container as the current operating system
user, inheriting access rights to the file system and so on. The
Hudson home directory will be set to the +.hudson+ folder in the user's
home directory. Once started the web-based Hudson user interface will
be available at
http://localhost:8080/hudson[http://localhost:8080/hudson]

[[fig-ci-quickstart-app-win]]
.Hudson Application Window
image::figs/web/home-job-list.png[scale=75]

NOTE: This approach is suitable for testing and exploring Hudson, but
it is not recommended to run Hudson as an executable WAR in
production.  Sure, it only took you a few seconds to download and
start Hudson, but running dependable development infrastructure
usually requires more than just a developer running "java -jar" from
the command-line.  If you really want to get serious about running
Hudson, configure Hudson as a service on Windows or Linux.

=== Deploy Hudson to a Servlet Container

Conveniently the WAR file is suitable to be deployed in most commonly
used Java servlet containers and application servers. The detailed
process differs for these containers but in general the required steps
are as follows:

Set up HUDSON_HOME::

  Hudson locates its configuration files and all other data in one
  folder and a collection of sub-folders to hold Job and build
  data. This folder should be configured by setting up an environment
  variable: +HUDSON_HOME+. The application will pick up this setting
  and use the specified folder to store job and configuration data.

Deploy to the server::

  Depending on the application server and your access rights you can
  deploy the WAR file via a web-based administration console or by
  copying the WAR into a deployment folder.  The details of each
  servlet container and application server are beyond the scope of
  this book.

////
TODO add a specific hudson user maybe .. but not when other stuff
    runs on app server .. then the app server user needs access to
    HUDSON_HOME and whatever.. 
////

When using Hudson on your application server, you should ensure that
the server is set up as an operating system service. The details of
this setup widely vary between operating systems and application
servers. The Hudson project provides helpful instructions for
installing Hudson on Glassfish, WebSphere, JBoss, Jetty, Tomcat,
Jonas, Weblogic and Winstone.  For more information, see
http://wiki.eclipse.org/hudson-ci/Containers

NOTE: The recommended installation process is to install Hudson as a
stand-alone service on a dedicated host using the operating
system-specific packages supplied by the Hudson web site and
documented in the following sections.  If you choose to run Hudson in
an application server or a servlet container, you may need to perform
complicated configuration changes to ensure that Hudson adheres to a
particular servers expectations.

[[section-install-deb]]
=== Installing Hudson on Ubuntu/Debian

Hudson provides a package repository of deb files for users of Debian
based distributions such as Debian, Ubuntu and others. This package
will install Hudson and set up the CI server as a service.

Step 1: Install Java runtime::

  In order to fulfill the prerequisite of an installed Java runtime on
  a Debian based distribution it is best to install the meta package
  +default-jdk+, which will install OpenJDK.  Either use a graphical
  user interface like +synaptic+ or install from the command-line
  with apt-get using the following command.

----
sudo apt-get install default-jdk
----

If you prefer to use the Oracle Java runtime install it with the
following apt-get command.

----
sudo apt-get install sun-java6-jdk
----

Step 2: Add Hudson repository URL to package management::

  The Hudson project hosts its packages in its own repository
  server. In order to use it you have to add its URL to your list of
  package sources with the following command.

----
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://hudson-ci.org/debian binary/' \ 
> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hudson.list"
----

You can also add the APT line +deb http://hudson-ci.org/debian
binary/+ in your GUI package manager as a repository URL.  Future
upgrades will not require this step to be repeated.

Step 3: Update the list of available packages::

  Once you've installed Java and added the Hudson repository URL you
  can update the list of available packages with the following
  command.

----
sudo apt-get update
----

This step has to be repeated whenever you want to check for the
availability of upgrades.  A common, best practice is to run +yum
update+ on a regular basis using cron this will alert you to updates
as they become available.

Step 4: Install Hudson::

Once your list of available packages is updated, you can install
Hudson with the following command:

----
sudo apt-get install hudson
----

As the hudson packages are signed with a key that isn't trusted by
default, the installation process requires your confirmation.  Once
you have verified that you would like to install Hudson without
verification, the installation process will then proceed to install
and start Hudson. Your console output will look similar to the
following output.

----
$ sudo apt-get install hudson

Not creating home directory `/var/lib/hudson'.
 * Starting Hudson Continuous Integration Server hudson  [ OK ]
----

As you can see from the output above, a hudson user was created. This
user will run the Hudson server. The Hudson home folder is configured
to point to the +/var/lib/hudson+ directory.  This is an important
directory to remember, as it contains configuration, workspaces, and
other files related to your project's builds.

NOTE: Take note, if you are backing up Hudson, you will want to
configure your backup systems to archive the contents of
+/var/lib/hudson+.  Everything interesting that relates to your
projects is contained in this directory.

Step 5: Upgrade Hudson::

  To upgrade Hudson when a new release is available you would run the
  following apt-get command.

----
sudo apt-get upgrade
----

This will stop the running Hudson server, upgrade Hudson and restart
the server. Prior to upgrading you should always backup your Hudson
configuration and workspace data located in +/var/lib/hudson+.

==== Hudson Filesystem on Ubuntu

Running +dpkg+ provides a list of the files installed by the Hudson
DEB package.  This list is a helpful guide for Hudson administrators
as it helps locate interesting configuration files and directories you
will need to know about when configuring and troubleshooting a Hudson
installation.

==== Starting and Stopping Hudson on Ubuntu

When you installed the Hudson DEB package on Ubuntu the installation
process configured Hudson as a service.  You can stop and start
the service with the following commands:

----
sudo service hudson stop
sudo service hudson start
----

Alternatively, you can use the following commands:

----
sudo /etc/init.d/hudson stop
sudo /etc/init.d/hudson start
----

==== Hudson Log Files on Ubuntu

Following the Linux Standard Base conventions Hudson creates its log
file in +/var/log/hudson/hudson.log+.  This log file will be rotated
automatically in the same way your syslog files are rotated on a
nightly schedule.

This log rotation schedule can be configured by altering the
configuration in +/etc/logrotate.d/hudson+.

==== Hudson Configuration on Ubuntu

The list of files installed by the Hudson DEB package reveal that a
configuration file +/etc/default/hudson+ was created.  This file
contains a number of configuration parameters that you might want to
adapt to your needs. These include:

JAVA_ARGS:: 

  Used to increase the memory allocation for Hudson

HTTP-PORT::

  Sets the Hudson port to a default of 8080.

HUDSON_HOME::

  Defines the default location of Hudson's working directory.

HUDSON_LOG::

  Defines the location of Hudson's log file.

MAXOPENFILES::

  Defaults to 8192.  This is an important configuration value for
  larger Hudson installations.  If you are running out of file handles
  you can increase this limit here.

AJP_PORT::

  This configuration parameter is disabled by default, but if you are
  planning on exposing your Hudson service via a web server using
  mod_jk or mod_proxy_ajp, you can configure the AJP port in this
  configuration file.

JAVA::

  Defaults to /usr/bin/java.  If you have a custom installation of
  Java, you can point your Hudson instance at a specific executable
  here.

HUDSON_USER:: 

  The DEB installer creates "hudson" user.  This value is configurable
  in case you need to run Hudson under a different user.

TIP: If you modify this file to suit your needs, you should add it to your
backup strategy.

[[section-install-rpm]]
=== Installing Hudson on Redhat, CentOS, and Fedora

Oracle Linux, Redhat Enterprise Linux, CentOS and Fedora all use the
same RPM package provided by the Hudson project. This package will
install Hudson and set it up as a service.

STEP 1: Install Java runtime::

  In order to fulfill the prerequisite of an installed Java runtime on
  a RedHat-based distribution it is best to install the meta package
  +java+, which will install OpenJDK, with your preferred package
  manager user interface. Either use a graphical user interface like
  +Add/Remove Software+ or install from the command-line with the
  following command.

----
sudo yum install java
----

STEP 2: Add Hudson repository URL to package management::

  The Hudson project hosts its packages in its own repository
  server. In order to reference these packages you have to add the
  repository metadata to your list of package sources with the
  following command.

----
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/hudson.repo http://hudson-ci.org/redhat/hudson.repo
----

Future upgrades will not require this step to be repeated.

STEP 3: Update the list of available packages::

  Once the prior steps are completed you can update the list of
  available packages in your graphical package manager or using the
  following yum command.

----
sudo yum check-update
----

This step has to be repeated whenever you want to check for the
availability of upgrades. A suggested best practice is to run "yum
check-update" on a regular basis and configure a system to notify you
when your system is eligible for updates.

STEP 4: Install Hudson::

  Once your list of available packages is updated, you can install
  Hudson with

----
sudo yum install hudson
----

This command will require your confirmation.  Once you've confirmed
that you want to install Hudson, yum will then proceed to install and
start Hudson. Your console output will look similar to the following
output.

----
$ sudo yum install hudson

STEP 5: Upgrade Hudson::

  To upgrade Hudson when a new release is available run the following
  command:

----
sudo yum update
----

This command stops the running Hudson server, upgrade Hudson and
restart the server. Prior to upgrading you might want to backup your
Hudson data configuration located in +/var/lib/hudson+ and owned by
the hudson user.

==== Hudson Filesystem on Redhat

Looking at the list of files installed by the package we see that this
RPM created the following files.

----
$ rpm -ql hudson
/etc/init.d/hudson
/etc/logrotate.d/hudson
/etc/sysconfig/hudson
/usr/lib/hudson
/usr/lib/hudson/hudson.war
/usr/sbin/hudson
/var/lib/hudson
/var/log/hudson
----

As part of the install a hudson user was created . This user will run
the Hudson server. The Hudson home folder is configured to be located
in +/var/lib/hudson+, which will contain configuration, workspaces and
so on and should be added to your backup strategy.

==== Starting and Stopping Hudson on Redhat

The install configured Hudson as a service so that you can stop and
start the service with the following commands:

----
sudo service hudson stop
sudo service hudson start
----

==== Hudson Log Files on Redhat

Following the Linux standard base convention Hudson will create its
log files into +/var/log/hudson/hudson.log+ and the log files will be
rotated on a nightly basis to preserve disk space.

==== Hudson Configuration on Redhat

This rpm command reveals that a configuration file
+/etc/sysconfig/hudson+ was created. It contains a number of
configuration parameters that you might want to adapt to your
needs. These include e.g. the +HUDSON_JAVA_OPTIONS+ that can be used
to increase the memory allocation for Hudson or the +HUDSON_PORT+
parameter set to the common 8080. If you modify this file to suit your
needs, you should add it to you backup strategy.

[[section-install-opensuse]]
=== Installing Hudson on OpenSUSE

OpenSUSE uses a special rpm package provided by the Hudson project.
This package will install Hudson and set it up as a service.

STEP 1: Install Java runtime::

  In order to fulfill the prerequisite of an installed Java runtime on
  openSUSE it is best to install the meta package +java+, which will
  install OpenJDK, with your preferred package manager user
  interface. Either use a graphical user interface like +YaST+ or
  install from on the command-line with

----
sudo zypper install java
----

STEP 2: Add Hudson repository URL to package management::

  The Hudson project hosts its packages in its own repository
  server. In order to use it you have to add the repository meta data
  to your list of package sources with

----
sudo wget -O /etc/zypp/repos.d/hudson.repo http://hudson-ci.org/opensuse/hudson.repo
----

Future upgrades will not require this step to be repeated.

STEP 3: Update the list of available packages::

  Once the prior steps are completed you can update the list of
  available packages in your graphical package manager or with

----
sudo zypper refresh
----

This step has to be repeated whenever you want to check for the
availability of upgrades. Common practice is for the update of the
list to run automatically on a regular basis.

STEP 4: Install Hudson::

  Once your list of available packages is updated, you can install
  Hudson with

----
sudo zypper install hudson
----

This command requires you to confirm and will then proceed to install
and start Hudson. Your console output will look similar to this

----
$ sudo zypper install hudson

STEP 5: Upgrade Hudson::

  To upgrade Hudson when a new release is available you would run the
  following command:

----
sudo zypper update
----

This command stops the running Hudson server, upgrade Hudson and
restart the server. Prior to upgrading you might want to backup your
Hudson data configuration located in +/var/lib/hudson+ and owned by
the hudson user.

The install configured Hudson as a service so that you can stop and
start the service with the following commands:

----
sudo /etc/init.d/hudson stop
sudo /etc/init.d/hudson start
----

Following the Linux standard base convention Hudson will create its
log files into +/var/log/hudson/hudson.log+ and the log files will be
rotated so you will no accumulate large log files using up disk space.

Looking at the list of files installed by the package

----
$ rpm -ql hudson
/etc/init.d/hudson
/etc/logrotate.d/hudson
/etc/sysconfig/hudson
/etc/zypp/repos.d/hudson.repo
/usr/lib/hudson
/usr/lib/hudson/hudson.war
/usr/sbin/rchudson
/var/lib/hudson
/var/log/hudson
----

This command reveals that a configuration file +/etc/sysconfig/hudson+
was created. It contains a number of configuration parameters that you
might want to adapt to your needs. These include e.g. the
+HUDSON_JAVA_OPTIONS+ that can be used to increase the memory
allocation for Hudson or the +HUDSON_PORT+ parameter set to the common
8080. If you modify this file to suit your needs, you should add it to
you backup strategy.

As part of the install a hudson user was created . This user will run
the Hudson server. The Hudson home folder is configured to be located
in +/var/lib/hudson+, which will contain configuration, workspaces and
so on and should be added to your backup strategy.

[[ci-quickstart-sect-upgrading]]
=== Upgrading Hudson

Since Hudson separates it's configuration and data storage from the
application, it is easy to upgrade an existing Hudson
installation. After a full backup of all configuration and data, you
should be ready to proceed after notifying your users about potential
down-time. You might also want to disable all jobs before proceeding.

. For native package users this will be handled transparently with
their package management system. For WAR file based installs, you only
have to remove the old version WAR and replace it with the new version
in your application server.

[[ci-quickstart-sect-behind-proxy]]
=== Running Hudson Behind a Proxy

If you installed Hudson as a stand-alone application, Hudson is
running on a high-performance servlet. From a performance perspective,
there is no reason for you not to run Hudson by itself without a
proxy. Yet, more often than not, organizations run applications behind
a proxy for security concerns and to consolidate applications using
tools like +mod_rewrite+ and +mod_proxy+. For this reason, we've
included some brief instructions for configuring Apache HTTP. We
assume that you've already installed Apache 2, and that you are using
a Virtual Host for www.example.com.

Let's assume that you wanted to host Hudson behind Apache HTTP at the
URL http://www.example.com[http://www.example.com]. To do
this, you'll need to change the context path that Hudson is served
from.

. Need to explain how to run Hudson in the root context here 

. Restart Hudson and verify that it is available on
  http://localhost:8080/[http://localhost:8080/].

. Clear the Base URL in Hudson Application Server Settings in the administration interface.

At this point, edit the HTTP configuration file for the
www.example.com virtual host. Include the following to expose
Hudson via +mod_proxy+ at
http://www.example.com/[http://www.example.com/].

----
ProxyRequests Off 
ProxyPreserveHost On 

<VirtualHost *:80> 
  ServerName www.example.com 
  ServerAdmin admin@example.com 
  ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/
  ErrorLog logs/example/hudson/error.log
  CustomLog logs/example/hudson/access.log common
</VirtualHost>
----

If you just wanted to continue to serve Hudson at the '/hudson'
context path, you would include the context path in your +ProxyPass+
and +ProxyPassReverse+ directives as follows:

----
ProxyPass /matrix/ http://localhost:8082/matrix/
ProxyPassReverse /matrix/ http://localhost:8082/matrix/
----

Apache configuration is going to vary based on your own application's
requirements and the way you intend to expose Hudson to the outside
world. If you need more details about Apache httpd and +mod_proxy+,
please see http://httpd.apache.org[http://httpd.apache.org].

[[chapter-configuration]]
== Hudson Configuration

To configure Hudson, click on the Manage Hudson link in the left-hand
navigation menu, which will display the screen shown in
<<fig-config-manage-hudson>>. This chapter will focus on the Configure
System section.

[[fig-config-manage-hudson]]
.Managing Hudson
image::figs/web/manage-hudson.png[scale=75]

Depending on the plugins installed and activated on your Hudson
system, different sections will be available in the system
configuration section.  These will either be explained below or with a
plugin-specific section. For example the source code
management-related global configurations for the different SCM systems
is available in <<chapter-source-control>>.

[[section-global-hudson-configuration]]
=== Global Hudson Configuration

The first section in the Configure System screen contains options that
allow you to configure global Hudson configuration attributes. This
section is shown in <<fig-global-hudson-configuration>>.

[[fig-global-hudson-configuration]]
.Configuring Global Hudson Configuration
image::figs/web/global-hudson-configuration.png[scale=75]

Home Directory::

  This parameter displays the absolute installation path of the
  currently running Hudson system. It is not a runtime configurable
  parameter. It is set by the server on startup. By default it will be
  the value of the HUDSON_HOME environment variable or the +.hudson+
  folder in the home directory of the operating system user running
  Hudson. The value is displayed here to allow the administrator to
  verify the correct setting.

System Message::

  This message is displayed by Hudson in the main screen above the
  list of projects. It can be used as a welcome message or to
  e.g. broadcast upcoming maintenance to users of the Hudson instance
  via the user interface. It supports plain text as well as HTML
  snippets for formatting and enriching the message with dynamic
  content.  

# of Executors::

  This parameter controls the number of concurrent builds Hudson is
  configured to run. Optimal values in terms of performance will
  depend on the number of CPU's, IO performance and other hardware
  characteristics of the server running Hudson as well as the type of
  builds configured to run. A good starting point for experimentation
  is the number of CPUs.  

Quiet period::

  A Quiet Period as specified in this configuration causes Hudson to
  wait the specified number of seconds before a triggered build is
  started. If your Hudson project is constantly "flapping" (switching
  between failure and success frequently), you may want to set the
  Quiet period to achieve more build stability. Another scenario this
  can be helpful is when large commits to your source control system
  are typically carried out in multiple smaller commits within a short
  time frame, so that the committer has a chance to get everything in
  without a build kicking off straight after the first commit causing
  a build failure. Setting this number to a large amount can generally
  reduce the number of builds running for this project, which will
  reduce the overall load for your Hudson server.

SCM checkout retry count::

  The SCM checkout retry count determines the number of attempts
  Hudson makes to check out any updates when polling the SCM system
  for changes and finds the system to be unavailable.

Enable Security::

  The Enable Security check box switches on the security system that
  will require user-name and password for any access to run builds or
  change configurations of Hudson and build projects. A large number
  of configuration options and security providers can be used and more
  information can be found in <<chapter-security>>

Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits::

  This feature will enable improved security against Cross Site
  Request Forgery exploits and is recommended to be turned on when
  your Hudson instance is available to the public Internet. On the
  other hand it can be necessary to have this feature disabled, when
  your Hudson web interface is embedded in a dashboard type interface
  that also contains web content from other domains or even only
  internal server names or sub networks. In general it will not be
  necessary to enable this feature on an internal network, where only
  trusted parties have access to Hudson.  

Help make Hudson better...::

  By selecting this feature to be enabled you agree for anonymous
  usage statistics about your Hudson installation to be created and
  securely sent to the Hudson development team and made available to
  the user community. The data sent consists of 

* the Hudson version you are using

* operating system, JVM and number of executors for your master Hudson
   and any slaves being used

* the name and version of all activated plugins

* the number of each project type configured to run

* HTTP information as provided by your Hudson
  instance

[[section-configure-global-properties]]
=== Global Properties Configuration

The global properties configuration allows the definition of key-value
pairs that are exposed to all running builds as environment variables.
Simply select the check box Environment Variables and add the desired
name and value for the property in the interface displayed
in<<fig-configure-global-properties>>.

[[fig-configure-global-properties]]
.Configuring global properties
image::figs/web/configure-global-properties.png[scale=75]

Depending on the build system used they can be picked up with
different syntax e.g. $key or ${key}. By default a number of default
variables are populated by Hudson automatically. These include
job-related ones like +JOB_NAME+, +BUILD_TAG+ or +BUILD_NUMBER+,
Hudson node-related ones like +NODE_NAME+ or more global ones like
+JAVA_HOME+. A comprehensive list is available at env-vars.html on
your Hudson server
e.g. http://localhost:8080/env-vars.html[http://localhost:8080/env-vars.html]
as linked from the inline help for the properties configuration.

[[section-configure-jdk]]
=== Configuring JDK Installations

Hudson can support one or more JDK installations used for running your
builds. Setting up multiple JDK installs allows the configuration of
different projects being built by different Java versions in separate
jobs. You can use this to ensure e.g. that builds as well as test
suites run fine on an older Java version to ensure
compatibility. Another application would be to run with JDK versions
supplied by different vendors.

The most common configuration of a JDK is to point to the already
installed instance as used for running Hudson itself. This can be
achieved simply by supplying a name like +Open JDK 6+ in the Name
input field and the absolute path in the JAVA_HOME input field in the
screen as shown in <<fig-using-jdk-config>>.

[[fig-using-jdk-config]]
.Configuring JDK Installations
image::figs/web/configure-jdk.png[scale=75]

Furthermore it is possible to configure a JDK to be installed
automatically by specifying a name as before and then selecting the
Install Automatically check box. This exposes a drop-down labeled Add
installer which lets you choose from the options Install from Oracle,
Extract *.zip/*.tar.gz and Run Command as visible in <<fig-using-jdk-config>>.

All the automatic install configurations cause Hudson to wait for the
first build, which is configured to use a named instance of the JDK to
initiate the JDK installation. The JDK will be installed into a folder
in the tools directory in Hudson home using the tool name specified
as the folder name.

The option Install from Oracle brings up a drop-down to choose the
version as well as a check box that needs to be clicked to the JavaSE
license agreement.

If you select to use Extract *.zip/*.tar.gz as shown in
<<fig-extract-archive-installer>> you will be able to configure a
Label, the Download URL for binary archive and the Subdirectory of
extracted archive.

[[fig-extract-archive-installer]]
.Extract *zip/*.tar.gz archive Installer Configuration
image::figs/web/extract-archive-installer.png[scale=75]

If you specify a label, only Hudson nodes with the same label will use
this installer. By using different labels it is possible for example
to get the same tool installed on different nodes with different
operating systems from different automatic install setups. The
download URL specifies the full URL from which the JDK will be
downloaded. The actual download is run off the Hudson master, so that
any Hudson nodes that need the JDK installed do not need to have
access to the URL location. After successful download the JDK will be
installed in the specified sub directory in the tools folder
of the Hudson home directory.

[[fig-run-command-installer]]
.Run Command Installer Configuration
image::figs/web/run-command-installer.png[scale=75]

The last automatic installation option is the Run a command option
displayed in<<fig-run-command-installer>>. The Label options works the
same as for the archive extraction based install. The Command input
allows you to specify the shell command to execute on the node for the
install. Typically this is some package management invocation. The
resulting tool directory has to be specified in the Tool Home input
box.

Once more than one JDK is configured in the global settings, each
project configuration has an additional drop-down, which allows the
selection of the JDK to be used to build the project and is visible in
<<fig-extract-archive-installer>>

[[section-configure-ant]]
=== Configuring Ant Installations

In a similar fashion to the JDK install Apache Ant can be installed in
multiple versions to be available for your Hudson configured
builds. The default configuration is to supply a name like +Apache Ant
1 .8.2+ for the Ant installation and a value in the ANT_HOME input
that is defined by the absolute path to the folder containing your
pre-existing local Apache Ant install e.g.  +/opt/apache-ant-1.8.2+

Using a preinstalled Ant requires manual install or the use of your
operating system package management system, a provisioning system or
as part of a virtual machine image management. To avoid this need
Hudson can install a required Apache Ant version automatically when
needed.

The simplest way to achieve this is to select the Install
automatically check box and select Install from Apache and choose the
desired version from the drop-down.

Similar to the JDK installation from Oracle it is possible to use
Install from Apache to get Ant installed into a subdirectory of the
tools folder in Hudson home. The options to install from
an archive or by running a command are available as well and work in
the same way as for JDK installs. A use case for an install from a
file would be a custom Ant distribution with libraries for in-house
tasks and maybe Ant contrib included as documented in detail in
<<chapter-ant>>

[[section-configure-maven]]
=== Configuring Maven Installations

One of the main uses cases for Hudson is building projects with Apache
Maven. As explained in more detail in <<chapter-maven>> the preferred
way to build Maven projects is the Maven 3 integration. It comes with
a bundled Maven 3 install so you do not actually need to install Maven
3 at all to get started. However if you want, you can install
additional Maven 3 installs with the user interface displayed in
<<fig-configure-maven-3-installation>>.

[[fig-configure-maven-3-installation]]
.Configuring Maven 3 Installations
image::figs/web/configure-maven-3.png[scale=75]

The legacy Maven project type and Maven plugin use a separate
installer as displayed in <<fig-configure-maven-installation>>. In
addition to the same features as the Maven 3 installer it can be
configured to download a Maven version from the Apache web site when
required.

[[fig-configure-maven-installation]]
.Configuring Maven Installations
image::figs/web/configure-maven.png[scale=75]

Both the Maven 3 and the Maven installation work in a similar way to
the JDK and Ant installation options:

Use an existing installation::

  Specify a Name and add the path to your Maven install in the
  MAVEN_HOME input control.

Automatically install from Apache::

  Select the Install automatically check box and Install from Apache in
  the drop-down and choose the Maven version, you wish to install.
  This option is only available for the Maven installation.

Automatically install from an archive file::

  Select the Install automatically check box and Extract *zip/*.tar.gz
  and configure the installation as documented in
  <<section-configure-jdk>>

Automatically install via a command::

  Select the Install automatically check box and Run Command and
  configure the installation as documented
  in<<section-configure-jdk>>.

In general we recommend that you run your build using the latest Maven
3.0 release. With multiple Maven installations configured a drop down
in the project build step configuration will allow you to choose the
desired Maven version.  <<chapter-maven>> provides an in-depth
documentation for using Maven with Hudson.

[[section-configure-maven-3-builder-defaults]]
=== Maven 3 Builder Defaults

The Maven 3 integration allows for a set of default values to be
defined that are used when a new build step for invoking Maven 3 is
added.  These values can be defined in the section Maven 3 Builder
Defaults in the global Hudson configuration here. The individual
fields and their purpose and usage are documented in
<<section-maven-3-build-configuration>>.

[[section-configure-shell]]
=== Configuring the Shell Executable

Hudson allows for the ability to configure shell builds. If you have a
build that requires the execution of shell scripts Hudson will by
default execute+/bin/sh+. For more complex builds scripts running on
different *nix environments, this can cause problems.  +/bin/sh+ often
symlinks to a concrete shell like bash, ash, zsh or ksh. This setup of
a specific shell will change from operating system to operating system
as well as from user to user. If your scripts depend on a specific
shell you should therefore specify your default shell in this input to
e.g.  +/bin/bash+. In a similar way you can add the path to a cygwin
install of e.g. bash on your Windows server to run unix scripts as
part of your build.

[[fig-using-shell-execute]]
.Configuring Shell Executable

[[section-configure-email-notification]]
=== Configuring E-mail Notification

Notification of build results and email-based notification
specifically is a core feature of a continuous integration
server. This configuration section as displayed in
<<fig-configure-email-notification>> allows you to configure the
SMTP-related settings to connect to the server and send the emails.

TIP: In general it can be advantageous to configure all email
recipients in Hudson as mailing list addresses. Combined with a
mailing list management system available to your potential recipients
e.g. development and QA team members, this setup allows users to join
any mailing list and therefore notifications for specific jobs without
any configuration changes on Hudson.

[[fig-configure-email-notification]]
.Configuring Email Notification

The following options can be configured:

  The SMTP server configuration is typically the IP number of the mail
  server or a fully qualified name including the domain e.g.
  +smtp.example.com+ . If the mail server is reachable by host name or
  some alias e.g.  +hermes+ from the Hudson server you can use it as
  the SMTP server configuration.

Default user e-mail suffix::

  This suffix is appended to the Hudson user names used to log in to
  Hudson and the result can be used for e-mail notification. E.g.  if
  the Hudson instance runs for +example.com+ you could supply the
  suffix of +@example.com+. A Hudson user with user name +jane.doe+
  would then receive email notifications at the
  email+jane.doe@example.com+.  This can be especially useful with
  security setups using an identity management system like LDAP for
  Hudson access as well as email address setup as documented in
  <<chapter-security>>.

System Admin E-Mail Address::

  This is the email address used as the email sender in any E-mail
  notification sent by the server. When configuring this email you
  should either ensure that emails sent back as a reply are monitored
  by somebody or bounced by the server with some meaningful error
  message.  

Hudson URL::

  The Hudson URL value will be used in the email notifications sent
  out to provide links to build results and so on. Provide a URL that
  will be valid for the audience of your notifications. If all
  recipients will be on an intranet or VPN you can use a non-public
  URL or IP number.

  In addition to basic SMTP configuration parameters, you can click
  the Advanced Options button for further configuration that allows
  you to send email via servers that require authentication. Most SMTP
  servers will require at least user name and password to be accessed.

Use SMTP Authentication::

  Clicking on the check box will reveal User Name and Password input
  fields. Depending on the server configuration your user name will be
  just the login name or the full email address or either.

Use SSL::

  Select this check box if your SMTP server supports connecting with
  SSL activated.

SMTP Port::

  This configuration allows you to specify a custom port for the
  communication with mail server. If the field is left empty the
  default ports are used. These are 25 for SMTP and 465 for SSL
  secured SMTP. It is a common practice to configure a different port,
  so be sure to check with the administrator of the mail server what
  port you should be using.

Charset::

  The Charset configuration determines the character set used for the
  composed e-mail message.

Test configuration::

  Pressing this button will execute the current configuration for
  sending emails. Depending on your configuration and network setup
  you should receive an email after a short while.

[[section-configure-email-gmail]]
==== E-mail Notification Via Gmail

In order to use GMail to send your emails you will need to configure
the SMTP server to +smtp.gmail.com+. In addition you will have to
have a Gmail account and provide the GMail e-mail address, or any
other email address configured to be accepted in your Gmail account,
as the User Name and configure the Password.

=== Troubleshooting E-mail Notification

Spam filter related problems::

  One of the common problems for build server notification emails not
  being received are spam filter setting on the server and/or client
  side of the recipient. Most spam filter systems will allow you to
  access a list of filtered message and configure a white list of
  senders. Adding the System Admin E-mail Address to the white list
  will ensure that your build notifications reach you.

[[section-configure-maven-3-configuration]]
=== Managing Maven 3 Configuration

The Maven 3 integration of Hudson provides you with the ability to
manage custom Maven configuration files directly through the Hudson
user interface. You can manage:

* Maven Settings Configuration

* Maven Toolchains Configuration

=== Opening the Maven 3 Configuration Page

To open the Maven 3 Configuration page, click on Manage Server in the
left-hand Hudson menu, and then select the Maven 3 Configuration item
shown in<<fig-config-manage-hudson>>.

Once you select the Maven 3 Configuration option, you will see the
page shown in <<fig-manage-mvn-3-configurations>>. If you have already
configured Maven Settings or Maven Toolchains configuration documents
they will appear in the list of documents shown on this page.  If you
have not configured any Maven configuration documents, you will see
the empty configuration screen shown
in <<fig-manage-mvn-3-configurations>>.

[[fig-manage-mvn-3-configurations]]
.The Maven 3 Configuration Page
image::figs/web/manage-mvn-3-configurations.png[scale=75]

To create a new Maven 3 Configuration document, click on the Add
button. This will create a new configuration document and display a
form that will allow you to name the document, describe the document,
select a document type, and supply configuration content for a
configuration document.

To remove an existing document, select the document from the list of
documents shown and click on the Remove button. This will load a
confirmation dialog. If the action is confirmed, the document will be
permanently removed from your Hudson instance.

Click the Refresh button in the interface to reload the Hudson
configuration and display any configuration documents which may have
been altered since you first loaded this page.

=== Managing Maven 3 Settings Configuration

To create a new Maven 3 Setting configuration file which can be
referenced by a Hudson Maven 3 build step, click on the Add button as
shown in <<fig-manage-mvn-3-configurations>>.  Clicking on Add will
display a form containing the ID, Type, Name, Description, and
Attribute fields as shown in <<fig-manage-mvn-3-settings>>. Select
SETTINGS for the Type field.

[[fig-manage-mvn-3-settings]]
.Managing Maven 3 Settings in Hudson
image::figs/web/manage-mvn-3-config-settings.png[scale=75]

The sample Maven 3 Settings configuration shown in
<<fig-manage-mvn-3-settings>> define a General Maven 3 Settings file
which configures all Maven 3 builds to read artifacts from a corporate
Nexus repository. This sample XML was copied from
http://www.sonatype.com/books/nexus-book/reference/maven-sect-single-group.html[the
Maven 3 Settings example] in the Sonatype Nexus book and customized to
reference a hypothetical server running on +nexus.sonatype.org:8081+.

Usage of the Maven 3 Settings configuration file in a Hudson job as
well as Maven toolchains is documented in
<<section-maven-3-build-configuration>>.

[[section-view-configuration]]
=== Configuring Global and Individual Project List Views

Running a Hudson server or grid with many projects can make the list
of configured jobs very long and therefore make it difficult for users
and administrators to gather the information they need at a glance and
find their way to the job they are interested in. To provide this
needed ease of access Hudson supports the addition of globally visible
as well as user specific views to the main page displayed in
<<fig-ci-quickstart-app-win>>.

To add a new view simply click the + button beside the default list
called All on top of the job list. If this button is not visible you
do not have the access right to create views. Creating a view this way
will make it globally visible to any user.

Logging in as a specific user shows the My Views option in the left
hand navigation menu. When you select this option the bread crumb
navigation will contain your user name and the My Views option.
Pressing the + button on the main job list now will create a
personal view only visible to the current user when logged in.

Each view can be given a description by clicking the edit
description on the right side above the job list.

When adding a new global view as displayed in
<<fig-configure-new-global-view>> you have to provide a name and
then select what type of view you want to add. You can either add a
My View, which will display all jobs the current users has access
to or you can add a List View, which is a highly configurable list
of job types. The different configuration options are documented
below.

[[fig-configure-new-global-view]]
.Adding a New Global View
image::figs/web/configure-new-global-view.png[scale=75]

After you have created the view you can configure the main filter
properties displayed in <<fig-configure-view-main>>,
configure, add and delete job filters as displayed in
<<fig-configure-view-filters>> and add and delete columns for the list
view as displayed in <<fig-configure-view-columns>>.

[[fig-configure-view-main]]
.Main Properties for Adding a New View
image::figs/web/configure-view-main.png[scale=75]

Besides the name provided at creation you can add a description
that will be displayed above the list of jobs and below the title
of the view. It can use HTML for e.g. hyperlinks to other related
resources. The Filter build queue option causes Hudson to only
show jobs from the view in the build queue. The Filter build
executors option causes Hudson to only show build executors  that
could execute shows from this view.

The Job Filters configuration below as visible in
<<fig-configure-view-filters>> shows the Status Filter,
a list of all jobs and allows the configuration of a regular
expression for inclusion of jobs on the list view. The regular
expression is applied to the job name.

[[fig-configure-view-filters]]
.Configuring View Filters
image::figs/web/configure-view-filters.png[scale=75]

The Status Filter has the option to use all selected jobs or only
enabled or disabled builds from the list below or the result of the
 regular expression configured. The Jobs list itself
is an alphabetically sorted list of all jobs configured with a
check box for each job that you potentially want to include in the
view. As an alternative to manually selecting jobs from the list
you can configure a regular expression to match on the job names.
With a good naming convention for the jobs this can be a good way
to build the list. An example could be naming all release build
jobs x-y-z-release or naming all plugin builds Plugin-x and then
using a regular expression like .*-release or Plugin-.* to select
them.

In addition to the plain selection filters there are a number of
specific filters available that can be added for further filtering.
The filters will be applied in the order in the configuration screen.
Each filter has a Match Type drop down selector that allows you to
include matched or unmatched jobs as well as exclude matched and
unmatched jobs from further filtering.

A myriad of combinations is possible allowing you to implement easy
access to all your builds for all your users catered to their
varying needs

With the Build Statuses filter displayed in
<<fig-configure-view-filters-build-status>> you can include or
exclude builds that are currently building, that have never been built
or that are currently in the build queue.

[[fig-configure-view-filters-build-status]]
.Configuring the Build Status View Filter
image::figs/web/configure-view-filters-build-status.png[scale=75]

The Job Statuses filter in <<fig-configure-view-filters-job-status>>
allows  you to combine Stable, Failed, Unstable, Aborted and Disabled
statuses to create a filter for including or excluding jobs from
your view.

[[fig-configure-view-filters-job-status]]
.Configuring the Job Status View Filter
image::figs/web/configure-view-filters-job-status.png[scale=75]

Similarly the Job Type filter in
<<fig-configure-view-filters-job-type>> can be used to include or
exclude based on the job being a free-style project, a Maven2/3
project, a multi-configuration project or a monitor of an external
job.

[[fig-configure-view-filters-job-type]]
.Configuring the Job Type View Filter
image::figs/web/configure-view-filters-job-type.png[scale=75]

The Other Views filter in <<fig-configure-view-filters-other>> has a
selector for the other view which can be used for including or
excluding jobs to the current view being configured. This allows
you to easily create negations of other views e.g. all non release
builds, or all non plugin builds or simply create a finer grained
view of a different view. E.g. you could easily create a view of
all plugin build that are currently with the job status Failed
using a combination of the Other Views and the Job Statuses filter.
Another good use case for this filter is to use multiple Other Views
filters to aggregate the content of a number of other views.

[[chapter-security]]
== Securing Hudson

Hudson's security configuration can span a wide spectrum: from a
simple Hudson instance running on a local network with no configured
security, to an instance of Hudson supporting thousands of developers
and thousands of projects with a security model providing isolation
and access-control supporting a highly secured environment.  Whether
you support a local team of developers accessing an unsecured Hudson
instance or a distributed enterprise team involving internal and
external collaborators such as vendors and consultants, Hudson's
security supports almost any conceivable use-case for authorization
and access control.

This chapter provides an overview of the approaches to authentication
and authorization in Hudson.  After reading this chapter you will be
able to take a Hudson instance and secure it allowing only authorized
users to administer, access, and alter Hudson build jobs.

=== Security Settings Overview

Out of the box Hudson has no security enabled.  To enable security,
check Enable security in the global configuration of Hudson as
displayed in <<fig-global-hudson-configuration>>.  Once you have
enabled security you will be able to set up your desired security
settings with the options visible in <<fig-security-overview>> and
documented in this chapter.

[[fig-security-overview]]
.Overview of the available security settings
image::figs/web/security-overview.png[scale=75]

=== Miscellaneous Security Related Settings

TCP port for JNLP slave agents::

  The port configuration should be set to Disable for Hudson
  deployments without any slave nodes. With slave nodes you can set
  the port to the default Random port. Hudson will randomly choose a
  port avoid port collisions with other services. When running Hudson
  cluster within a firewall-secured environment, you can choose a
  fixed port and then ensure that the port is open on the respective
  servers.

Markup Formatter::

  Raw HTML is the default setting that causes Hudson to render any
  input data from text fields as HTML in the user interface. This
  allows for added links and more, but also has the potential for
  cross site scripting XSS attacks. Currently plugins that implement
  other markup are planned, but not yet available for Hudson.

=== Authentication and Authorization

With security enabled, Hudson supports the following authentication
security realms out of the box. Further options are available as
plugins.

* Delegate to servlet container

* Unix user/group database

* Hudson's own user database

* LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

Access-control schemes available are:

* Logged-in users can do anything

* Matrix-based security

* Project-based Matrix Authorizations Strategy

* Legacy mode

* Anyone can do anything

These security options can be seen in <<fig-security-overview>> and
are documented in detail below.

=== Configuring Security Realms: Authentication

The configuration of the security realm allows you to define where
user names and passwords are stored and administered.  Depending on
your deployment it can be useful to tie into already existing systems
or run a separate realm for Hudson.

==== Delegating to a Servlet Container

The default setting for a Hudson instance is no security.  If you are
running Hudson from a servlet container you may have access to
management consoles that allow you to maintain and administer users
and groups.  Hudson can be configured to both delegate authorization to
a servlet container and use these users and groups for access-control.

This feature can be especially useful if other application are already
using the servlet container authorization and you want to achieve a
single-sign on for all applications running on this server or cluster
of servers or you simply prefer to manage your users from the
application server user interface.

==== Relying on Unix Users and Groups

If you select this option, Hudson will consult the Unix user/group
database on the machine it is running on. To do so it will use
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluggable_Authentication_Modules[Pluggable
Authentication Modules (PAM)]. The user running Hudson has to be able
to access PAM and be a member of the +shadow+ group.  As visible in
<<fig-security-unix>> the setup allows for the definition of a service
name and test via provided button.

[[fig-security-unix]]
.Overview of the available security settings
image::figs/web/security-unix.png[scale=75]

TIP: If you get a stack trace about not being able to find the file
libpam.so you may need to create a symbolic link using the command
line shown below.

----
sudo ln -s /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0 /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so
----

On most Unix systems, the users and groups are stored in +/etc/passwd+
and +/etc/group+, but your results may vary depending on the Unix/Linux
version and the security setup of your specific machine.  With this
setup user and group administration is entirely separate from your
Hudson install. Use the your preferred administration tool on the
command line or a graphical user interface.

A consequence of using this security realm is that the Hudson instance
and access details are tied to the specific server Hudson is running
on. This means that the user and group setup should be backed up in
addition to the Hudson data itself and security information can not be
easily migrated unless some sort of single sign-on (SSO) is used across all
servers. 

This approach is ideal for simple installations of Hudson on a single
machine, or when you have integrated PAM with a single sign-on
solution such as LDAP.

==== Using the Hudson Internal User Database

A convenient method to control access to Hudson without external
dependencies is to use the internal user database of Hudson itself. To
activate this feature select Hudson's own user database as displayed
in <<fig-security-hudson-db>>

[[fig-security-hudson-db]]
.Overview of the available security settings
image::figs/web/security-hudson-db.png[scale=75]

The option "Allow user to sign up" activates the Sign Up screen as
displayed in <<fig-security-signup>>, which also displays a captcha
that is displayed when the option "Enable captcha on sign up" is
activated.

[[fig-security-signup]]
.Sign up screen for new users
image::figs/web/security-signup.png[scale=75]

By providing all details in the sign up form a user can create an
account to access Hudson. Once a user is signed up and logged in they
can use then click on their user name in the top left corner and then
on the Configure option in the left hand menu to access their user
configuration screen.  A user's configuration screen gives users the
ability to reset and change passwords as well as update contact
information such as name, description, and email.

[[fig-security-user-configure]]
.User configuration
image::figs/web/security-user-configure.png[scale=75]

To manage users click on Manage Users in the global Manage Hudson
screen displayed in <<fig-config-manage-hudson>>.  In this management
section the administrator has the option to create and manage
users. The Create User link in the left-hand navigation menu presents
the Sign Up screen from <<fig-security-signup>> without the captcha to
the administrator allowing account creation to be controlled by an
administrator rather than a self-serve signup. In addition this screen
shows a list of users already registered with Hudson and allows the
administrator to delete users and edit them via the user configuration
screen from <<fig-security-user-configure>>.

==== Light-weight Directory Authentication Protocol (LDAP)

If you have an LDAP server, Hudson can be configured to use this
server to authenticate users. The administration interface in
<<fig-security-ldap>> allows you to provide all the necessary details
for Hudson to connect to your LDAP server. You will be able to connect
to most common LDAP servers. If you want to configure security with
Microsoft Active Directory you should also have a look at the specific
plugin for Active Directory.

[[fig-security-ldap]]
.Overview of the available security settings
image::figs/web/security-ldap.png[scale=75]

Server::

  The server connection string is typically composed of a protocol of
  ldap:// or ldaps://, a server name and a colon followed by a
  port. The default ldap protocol and port 389 can be omitted, so the
  simplest server would be the server name or IP number only. Further
  valid examples are e.g.  directory.example.com:1389 or
  ldaps://directory.example.com:1636.  The default port for ldaps is
  636.

root DN::

  Specify the root DN for you want to use for
  authentication. Typically this would be a value like
  dc=example,dc=com

User search base and User search filter::

  The user search base and use search filter fields allow you to
  define a subtree to look for user records within the root DN. E.g
  the search base could be ou=people or ou=developers and the search
  filter could be the default uid={0} or mail={0} for users logging in
  with their email address. If you need to further define your search
  filter you can use {0} as the pattern that will be replaced with the
  user name in the search.

Group search base::

  Define the query to locate the list of groups for a user in this
  query that is typically just empty to search in the root DN or
  ou=groups. More complicated queries are possible the {0} as pattern
  for the user name replacement.

Manager DN and Manager Password::

  The Manager DN and password are required for Hudson to connect to
  your LDAP server to query for the user details. The DN is only
  necessary if you server does not support anonymous bind and
  typically looks something like this
  CN=MyUser,CN=Users,DC=mydomain,DC=com.

Beyond the standard settings LDAP configuration can require further
tweaks documented in the following section.

In general all the LDAP queries are space sensitive and their content
is specific to your LDAP server configuration which can differ widely
depending on your specific organization's LDAP configuration.

If login attempts result in "Administrative Limit Exceeded" or similar
error message, any LDAP query but often specifically the LDAP query to
determine the group membership triggers it. A general tip in this
situation is to try setting the "Group search base" and other settings
as specific as possible for your LDAP structure, to reduce the scope
of the query.

If the error persists, you may need to edit the
WEB-INF/security/LDAPBindSecurityRealm.groovy file that is included in
hudson.war. Change the line with groupSearchFilter = "(| (member={0})
(uniqueMember={0}) (memberUid={1}))"; to query only of the field used
in your LDAP for group membership, such as groupSearchFilter =
"(member={0})"; (then restart Hudson).

In general Hudson will prefix any LDAP group with the ROLE_ prefix.
This has to be taken into account when configuring access rights in a
matrix based security realm. For example, the LDAP group developers
(cn=developers) would be used as ROLE_DEVELOPERS.  In Hudson, Group
names are translated to all uppercase and non-alpha characters such as
hyphen, space and comma are not supported.

Hudson's LDAP integration currently does not support indirect group
memberships.

=== Configuring an Access-control Strategy

Once you've selected a security realm for authorization you'll know
how users and groups are created and what has to be done for a user to
be able to log in to Hudson. As a next step you need to decide on your
Hudson instance's approach to access-control.  Access control settings
determine what a user can do and see once they are logged in.

==== Logged-in users can do anything

This authorization strategy grants read access to Hudson to anonymous
users, but restricts administrative access to users with a valid
account. Once the user is logged-in they have full access rights to
everything including project deletion and other critical
functionality. You should be certain to have a good backup strategy in
place for critical data and that your users are capable of using
Hudson in an administrative function before you opt to use this
authorization strategy.

[[section-security-authorization-matrix]]
==== Matrix-based security

For more fine grained control over what specific users or groups of
users can do, you can configure Hudson to use Matrix-based security as
visible in a minimal configuration in
<<fig-security-authorization-matrix>>.

[[fig-security-authorization-matrix]]
.Matrix based security
image::figs/web/security-authorization-matrix.png[scale=75]

Using the input field for User/group you can create new rows in the
security matrix. The matrix provides sections to configure access
rights for the following permissions categories:

* Overall - permissions which govern global activities such as administration rights
* Slave - permissions relating to the management of Hudson slave instances
* Job - job permissions whether a user can create, manage, edit, and delete jobs
* Run - permissions about specific build jobs
* View - permissions about build job views
* SCM - permissions related to source code management systems

A typical minimal configuration would be to grant all rights to an
administrative user or group and only read access for Overall and Jobs
to anonymous users.

By adding further groups or individual users you can e.g. grant full
administrative access rights to other trusted users without sharing
the main admin account.  

TIP: A safe administrative use would be to grant full rights to a
group of admin users without granting any Delete rights.

[[section-security-authorization-project]]
==== Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy

Taking the concept of matrix based authorization as described in
<<section-security-authorization-matrix>> a step further is
Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy. The global configuration
possible as displayed in <<fig-security-authorization-project>> works
the same as matrix-based security.

[[fig-security-authorization-project]]
.Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy
image::figs/web/security-authorization-project.png[scale=75]

In addition you can enable project-based security in each project
configuration individually for each project. Enabling the option
Enable project-based security will display a matrix of access rights
as visible in <<fig-security-authorization-project-specific>>. It will
allow you to add users and groups just like for the global
configuration and assign rights as desired.

[[fig-security-authorization-project-specific]]
.Project specific authorization
image::figs/web/security-authorization-project-specific.png[scale=75]

Using groups accessing a group of projects you could e.g.  enable
administrative rights for a limited number of projects to a specific
user or user group.

==== Anyone can do anything

This option is something of a free for all - an uncontrolled Hudson
instance with no access-control rules defined.

Setting your authorization strategy to the option "Anyone can do
anything" effectively turns off security. In a scenario where
everybody able to access Hudson e .g. in a trusted intranet this
setting is recommended as an alternative to completely disabled
security. The advantage for the users is that while they do not need
to login to use Hudson and everyone has access it is possible to login
and customize Hudson by creating custom views and take advantage of
other personalization options.

=== Hudson Security Best Practices, Tips and Tricks

==== Common Setup - Internal matrix-based authorization

A common and useful setup is a combination of using Hudson's internal
user database with matrix-based authorization. It allows for a secure
setup of a publicly available Hudson instance without the need for any
further security components beyond Hudson itself and can therefore be
managed via the Hudson user interface without any additional
requirements beyond browser access.

. Enable security in the global Hudson configuration

. Activate the security realm for Hudson's own user database and allow
  users to sign up

. Set the authorization to "Anyone can do anything" and save the
  configuration

. Sign up a new user e.g. with the name +admin+

. Login in as the new user

. Change the authorization to matrix-based security

. Add the new user to the matrix

. Grant all right to the new user as he will the be the administrator
  user

. Save the configuration

Following these steps you will have secured Hudson and the new user
will be the only user with access to Hudson. If you want anonymous
users to have read access you could add these rights in the matrix.

For further users you can create additional matrix rows and distribute
rights as desired.

=== Disabling security when locked out

When configuring security or when relying on external security realms,
you can end up in situations where you do not have any access to
Hudson in the user interface.  Reasons could be a forgotten admin
password, offline LDAP server, broken Unix authorization after server
upgrade and so on. To be able to fix your setup you can edit the
file 'config.xml' in your HUDSON_HOME and set

----
<useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
----

With this setting you will have full access to Hudson and be able to
troubleshoot your configuration or change to a new security realm
and/or authorization.

[[chapter-plugin-management]]
== Managing Hudson Plugins

Hudson plugin management is available via Manage Hudson and selecting
the Manage Plugins link shown in <<fig-config-manage-hudson>>. This
administration interface allows you see what plugin versions are
currently installed, update them and install new ones as well as
manage some advanced settings to work with the multitude of plugins
available for Hudson. Using plugins allows you to support many new
features beyond a basic Hudson install as well as tweak the user
interface and morph Hudson into the CI server you need.

[[section-plugin-management-installed]]
=== Installed Plugins

To get a list of installed plugins, click in the Installed tab. This
will display a list all of the Hudson plugins currently installed on
your instance of Hudson system.

[[fig-using-installed-plugin]]
.The Installed tab for managing the installed plugins
image::figs/web/plugin-mgt-installed.png[scale=75]

The Enabled check box allows you to activate and deactivate specific
plugins. After plugin updates your old plugin version will remain
accessible and you can downgrade to the older version by pressing the
Downgrade to x.y.z button. The pinned column will then be marked for
this plugin so that automatic updates will not occur until you unpin
the version. Any changes will require you to restart Hudson by
clicking the "Restart once no jobs are running button" as displayed in
<<fig-plugin-mgt-progress>>.

[[section-plugin-management-available]]
=== Available Plugins

This list of available plugins includes hundreds of useful utilities,
tweaks, and feature sets which extend the core feature set of
Hudson. The list is separated into topics and contains a short
description for each plugin as well as a link to the plugin web
site. In order to install a plugin, simply select the check box in the
plugin row, press the Install button on the bottom of the list. This
will redirect to a progress reporting page. After a success message
you will have to restart Hudson by clicking the Restart once no jobs
are running button for the new plugin to be available.

[[section-plugin-management-updates]]
=== Plugin Updates

Hudson regularly checks an available list of Hudson plugins on the
Hudson web site and will notify if an update becomes available. To see
if any updates are currently available click on the Updates tab in the
Manage Plugins screen. Plugins eligible for an update will be displayed
next to the available update version and the version which is
currently installed. To update a plugin select the check box in the
Install column and press the Install button on the bottom of the
list. This will redirect to a progress reporting page. After a success
message you will have to restart Hudson by clicking the "Restart once
no jobs are running" button for the new plugin to be available.

[[section-plugin-management-advanced]]
=== Advanced Plugin Settings

The Advanced tab as displayed in <<fig-plugin-mgt-advanced>> allows
you to configure the proxy settings for Hudson to be able to connect
to the plugin repository on the Hudson web site, upload Hudson plugin
files (+*.hpi+) manually, and specify the URL for a custom update
site.

[[fig-plugin-mgt-advanced]]
.The Advanced tab for miscellaneous plugin management tasks
image::figs/web/plugin-mgt-advanced.png[scale=75]

=== HTTP Proxy Configuration

Hudson retrieves a list of plugins and downloads plugins over the
public Internet. If your server is behind a proxy server, you will
need to configure the proxy settings. Supply the necessary values to
connect to your internal proxy in the Server and Port fields. The No
Proxy for field allows you to exclude host names from proxying by
adding them to a comma separated list.  If your proxy server requires
authentication you will have to select the Proxy Needs Authorization
check box and provide the User name and Password.

=== Upload Plugin

Hudson plugins are distributed as +.hpi+ files and the the Advanced
administration section allows you to upload them with a file
chooser. This feature is especially useful for installing custom
developed plugins or commercially distributed plugins that are not
available on the update site. You can also use it to install plugins
you build from source during development or when helping by
contributing fixes to open source plugins.

=== Update Site

Instead of using the public update site on the Hudson web site you can
host your own plugin repository and you can then add the URL in the
available input field.  This approach is useful if you need to
maintain a secured Hudson instance that cannot be affected by the day
to day changes on an external Hudson plugin update site.  If you use
this option, you can point your Hudson instance at a local copy of the
public Hudson plugin update site and strictly control the changes that
are visible to your Hudson instance.

[[chapter-build-creation]]
== Creating Hudson Projects

Once you've downloaded, installed, and started Hudson for the first
time, the next step is to start creating new Hudson build jobs.  As
you'll learn in the following chapter, there are an innumerable number
of options, plugins, and extensions that can make the Hudson build job
creation process a bit daunting to the first time user.

From SCM configuration to options relating to build triggers Hudson
offers so many configuration points it is often difficult for new
users to make sense of the process.  This chapter takes the mystery
out of build job creation and explores some of the options available
when creating a new Hudson project.  After reading this chapter,
you'll know what fields matter (and which fields can be safely
ignored), you'll understand how to stand up a new Hudson build job,
and you'll be ready to get started using the best CI server in the
industry.

[[section-creating-new-project]]
=== Creating New Hudson Projects

To create a new Hudson project, click on New Job in the left
navigation menu, which will display the form shown in
<<fig-using-new-project>>.

[[fig-using-new-project]]
.Creating a New Job in Hudson
image::figs/web/create-new-job.png[scale=75]

The most common way to create a new job using Hudson is to select
"Build a free-style software project". If you are creating a project
that is similar to an existing Hudson build, you may also choose "Copy
an existing job" and then type in the name of the Hudson job in the
Copy from text field. Once you have made your selection and provided a
name for the new job, click on OK to continue.

////
TODO: The following paragraph could use some attention.
////

You can also configure Hudson to Monitor an external job which can
then trigger and affect other jobs. The last job type supported by
Hudson is to Build a multi-configuration project, which can act like a
container for a variety of different job executions.

WARNING: Your Hudson installation may provide an option to Build a
Maven 2/3 project (Legacy). This feature has numerous issues with the
use of different Maven versions, and it is especially problematic when
building a project with Maven 3.  The authors of this book recommend
not to using the legacy Maven project type.  Instead, we encourage you
to use the native Maven support which is available in a free-style
software project.

[[fig-using-new-project-result]]
.Result of New Project Creation
image::figs/web/new-project-result.png[scale=75]

Once your job has been created, you will see a screen similar to the
one shown in <<fig-using-new-project-result>>, depending on your job
type selection. You can now proceed to configure your project. If you
need to change any of these settings at a later stage, navigate to a
particular Hudson Project's Summary page by clicking on the name of
the project on the main Hudson page. Once you are on a Hudson
Project's Summary page, click on Configure in the left-hand navigation
to load the Project Configuration screen.

[[section-common-job-configurations]]
=== Configuring Common Job Configuration Settings

Independent of the job type you selected you will be able to configure
a few common settings separated in the following sections:

General Project Settings::

  Configure the project name, description and other general parameters

Advanced Project Options::

  Configure miscellaneous settings for advanced usage.

Source Code Management::

  Configure source code management-related parameters for various
  systems

Build Triggers::

  Configure how builds are started

Post-build Actions::

  Configure steps taken after a build completion

Depending on the job type you choose additional sections may be
present in the project configuration screen.  The following sections
provide an overview of some common project configuration options.

[[section-configuring-general-project-settings]]
==== Configuring General Project Settings

The first section on the Project Screen is the general project
information, which is shown in <<fig-using-project-info>>.

[[fig-using-project-info]]
.Configuring Project Information
image::figs/web/ci-using-proj-info.png[scale=75]

The section shown in the previous figure contains the following
fields:

Project Name::

  The Project Name should be a short descriptive name that easily
  allows your Hudson users to see what this project is. Consider this
  to be the identifier that Hudson uses to keep track of everything
  associated to this project. We recommend that your project names
  consist of simple alphanumeric characters and dashes. While Hudson
  will save a Project name containing spaces, the file path of the
  workspace will also contain spaces. The presence of spaces in a
  project name can cause unforeseen issues with builds and may results
  in build failure. We suggest using e.g. underscores instead. The
  project name will be visible in the main Hudson page on the list of
  jobs.

Description::

  The Description should contain a paragraph that will inform Hudson
  users about the nature and purpose of a given Hudson project. Useful
  information for the users could for example be various source code
  management related parameters like branch or version or other
  parameters like target platform for the build artifacts. This will
  widely vary and depend on your job type. The description is visible
  on the main project-specific page.

Discard Old Builds::

  If Discard Old Builds is not checked, Hudson will archive the
  results of all the builds it performs. Depending on build log and
  artifact size this can produce considerable amounts of storage space
  being used, which should in turn be monitored carefully.  If Discard
  Old Builds is checked, the project configuration screen will display
  additional input fields that allow you to specify the number of
  builds and the number of days to retain builds. After pressing the
  Advanced button you can provide for separate configuration for the
  number of days the build artifacts are kept. Setting this value will
  cause older build artifacts to get deleted, without the logs,
  reports etc. getting deleted. An additional advanced configuration
  allows you to set maximum number of builds to keep including its
  artifacts.

This Build is Parameterized::

  Parameterized builds allow you to pass configuration to specific
  builds.  For example, you can parameterize a build to accept a
  free-form variable that selects a specific branch in SCM.  This way,
  a Hudson user can trigger a build and supply the name of this branch
  to the Hudson build.

Disable Build::

  If Disable Build is selected, no new builds will be executed until
  the project is re-enabled. This means that any builds that might
  have been triggered by SCM activity or by a periodic schedule will
  not be executed. This feature is very useful if you need to fix an
  issue with a build or build specific related infrastructure like
  source code management system and you want to temporarily take a
  particular Hudson job offline without affecting the rest of your
  Hudson setup and jobs.

Execute concurrent builds if necessary (beta)::

  If this check box is selected, Hudson will be able to execute more
  than one build for this project at the same time. This can be useful
  if your project is parameterized, or if you have a longer build,
  which may need to run multiple concurrent builds in response to
  independent changes to SCM. In many cases this setting is
  particularly useful, when Hudson is set up as a build cluster.

 JDK::

  This drop down allows the selection of a specific Java Development
  Kit (JDK) for the project. It will only be available if multiple
  JDKs are configured in the global Hudson configuration as documented
  in <<section-configure-jdk>>.

Restrict where this project can be run::

  If Restrict where this project can be run is checked, Hudson will
  display options that will allow you to specify the nodes on which a
  project build can be executed.

WARNING: If you are creating a continuous integration build that will
run frequently, don't forget to check Discard Old Builds and configure
Hudson to free up drive space. If your project is built regularly due
to frequent changes in source control or small times between fixed
schedule builds you can easily fill up even the largest hard drive
potentially resulting in your build server going offline.

[[section-configuring-advanced-project-options]]
==== Configuring Advanced Project Options

The next section after the general project configuration is the
Advanced Project Options section shown in <<fig-using-adv-opt>>.

[[fig-using-adv-opt]]
.Configuring Advanced Project Options
image::figs/web/ci-using-adv-opt.png[scale=75]

This section contains the following fields:

Quiet period::

  The project-specific Quiet Period set in this section overrides the
  global configuration documented in
  <<section-global-hudson-configuration>> and has the same
  effect. This setting depends on your build trigger configuration as
  documented below.

Retry Count::

  The project-specific Retry Count overrides the global SCM checkout
  retry count and has the same effect.

Block build when upstream/downstream project is building::

  Hudson builds can be configured to have upstream as well downstream
  dependencies. Upstream dependencies are projects upon which this
  particular project's build depends. Downstream dependencies are
  projects that depend on the current builds results. If Block build
  when upstream/downstream project is building is selected this
  project will not start a build, if an upstream/downstream project is
  in the middle of a build or in the build queue.

Use custom workspace::

  If this selection is checked, you can instruct Hudson to use a
  custom directory for this project's workspace. If this option is not
  checked, Hudson will automatically assign a workspace location that
  is based on the project's name. As such it can be used to have
  projects names with spaces or other characters potentially causing
  file system level issues while using a save name for the workspace
  folder name.

[[section-configuring-source-code-management]]
==== Configuring Source Code Management

Hudson is typically used in conjunction with the source of the project
available in a source code management system. Support for a large
variety of SCM's is one the strengths of Hudson. This section allows
for the configuration of the respective settings for your SCM of
choice. The available list of choices will contain all SCM systems
provided by Hudson and the installed plugins.
<<chapter-plugin-management>> explains how to get support for your SCM
installed, if it is not yet available. Once installed each SCM
configuration will have different parameters, which are documented in
<<chapter-source-control>>.

[[section-configuring-build-triggers]]
==== Configuring Build Triggers

The next section to configure is Build Triggers. A Hudson job can be
configured to build in response to build activity on a Hudson
instance, in accordance with a regular schedule, or as a reaction to
activity in an SCM system. Build triggers are configured on a
Project's Configuration screen and the section is shown in
<<fig-using-build-triggers>>.

[[fig-using-build-triggers]]
.Configuring Build Triggers
image::figs/web/ci-using-build-triggers.png[scale=75]

The following types of build triggers can be configured:

Build after other projects are built::

  If this option is selected, Hudson will present you with a text
  field that accepts the names of one or more projects. If this field
  is populated, Hudson will trigger this project's build after a
  successful completion of one of the projects listed in this text
  field. The reverse behavior of triggering a different project based
  on this project's build completing can be configured in the
  Post-build Actions.

Trigger builds remotely (e.g. from scripts)::

  Enabling this option will allow you to define a authentication token
  for triggering a build by hitting a project specific URL together
  with the defined token. The URL follows the patterns
  http://hudsonurl/jobs/project/build?token=mytoken&cause=mycause with
  hudsonurl replaced by the URL of your hudson server including port
  number and context (e.g. http://buildserver:8080/hudson).  mytoken
  will be the secret token you defined in the Authentication Token
  field and mycause an optional text to submit as the cause. To allow
  users to hit the URL you can e.g. host the link on a secured web
  page, send it via email or also use curl or wget from a script.

Build periodically::

  The Build periodically setting will cause Hudson to start a build of
  the project at regular intervals. Changes will be retrieved from the
  configured SCM, but a build will be triggered even if no changes
  were found.  The interval configuration in the exposed text field
  accepts the same cron syntax as the Poll SCM configuration.

Poll SCM::

  Selecting Poll SCM will cause Hudson to periodically poll your
  source code management system for changes and trigger a build if
  changes have been found and successfully retrieved. Selecting this
  option displays a text area, which accepts a standard cron
  expression. This allows for arbitrary polling interval from minutes
  to weekly and way beyond. It is important to consider the impact of
  this polling frequency setting on your SCM infrastructure, since it
  can cause significant load specifically when multiple projects with
  small polling frequencies all access the same SCM server. This
  expression can also be useful to set up a schedule for a project
  that only polls the SCM for changes e.g. outside office hours and
  therefore only builds then. Similar setup ups can be used to do a
  nightly or a weekly build type setup.

Build when Maven dependencies have been updated by Maven 3 integration::

  Hudson projects using the Maven 3 integration can be configured to
  send out a notification to all projects that Maven dependencies have
  been updated as post build action (see
  <<section-configuring-post-build-actions>>). When you activate this
  build trigger a build of the project will be started once a such a
  notification is received. The projects triggering each other in this
  set up needs to be configured to access the same Maven repository.

Build when Maven SNAPSHOT dependencies have been updated externally::

  Activating this setting allows you to specify a schedule in cron
  syntax to use for polling the local Maven repository for updated
  SNAPSHOT dependencies. When selecting the Exclude internally
  produced dependencies option the regular check will only cause a
  build trigger firing when artifacts not built in a local Hudson job
  are updated.

[[section-configuring-post-build-actions]]
==== Configuring Post-build Actions

Post build actions are an important part of Hudson. They allow you to
trigger a number of events upon build completion. These include the
communication of the results of the build in various ways as well as
chain other builds to this build. As such these actions fulfill a
crucial role of a continuous integration server as communication tool.
Other important actions allow you to deal with the various artifacts
produced by the build in the form of test results, documentation as
well as actual executables or archives produced.

Beyond the core post-build actions documented in the following,
various plugins will make additional actions available. Source code
management-related plugin documentation can be found in
<<chapter-source-control>>. The minimum list of build actions
available is visible in <<fig-post-build-actions>> and documented in
more detail below.

[[fig-post-build-actions]]
.Configuring Project Post-build Options
image::figs/web/post-build-actions.png[scale=75]

Archive Maven 3 artifacts::

  If you activating this option Hudson will archive the artifacts
  built by the Maven 3 build steps during the build. Selecting the
  Include generated POMs additional cause the pom.xml files to be
  archived. With the option Discard old artifacts set, old artifacts
  will be removed after each successful build. This is a Maven 3 build
  step specific automation of the option to Archive artifacts without
  the need to specify the artifacts. The artifacts will be made
  available on the web interface like other archived artifacts. This
  option is especially useful in refactorings of the project and the
  resulting artifacts, since all artifacts are always archived and
  name or folder changes do not affect the archiving. Since there is
  no necessity to configure matching patterns, this option is more
  robust.

Record fingerprints of Maven artifacts::

  This option activated will trigger the Maven 3 integration of Hudson
  to record fingerprints of the created Maven artifacts, which will
  allow Hudson to keep track of when these artifacts are produced and
  used.

Publish Javadoc::

  If your build produces Javadoc you can configure Hudson to make it
  available to users on the project page of Hudson:

[[fig-post-build-actions-javadoc]]
.Configuring the Javadoc post build action
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-javadoc.png[scale=75]

[[fig-post-build-actions-javadoc-junit-project]]
.Project page providing access to Javadoc and latest test results
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-javadoc-junit-project.png[scale=75]

To configure this you have to select the check box and provide the
relative path to the Javadoc in the Javadoc directory input
field. Checking the Retain Javadoc for each successful build will keep
the generated Javadoc for all successful builds in the specified
folder for older builds instead of overwriting the documentation with
each build.

If a warning of No such directory is visible, it means that the
current project workspace does not contain the specified path. This is
not a problem as long as your build will create the folder. The
Console Output of a specific build contains logging information
started by Publishing Javadoc that can be used to debug any problems.

Aggregate downstream test results::

  This feature allows you to pull the test results of this project and
  any downstream projects together. This is especially useful when
  long running test are set up as separate downstream projects. You
  can either let Hudson figure out all downstream projects
  automatically or supply a specific list of projects in the Jobs to
  aggregate input box.

[[fig-post-build-actions-aggregate-test]]
.Configuring the test result aggregation post build action
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-aggregate-test.png[scale=75]

Publish JUnit test result report::

  Activating this feature allows Hudson to interpret the JUnit test
  report format, produced by your test runs in the project and produce
  historic test result trends, a web interface for viewing the reports
  accessible from the project page as visible in
  <<fig-post-build-actions-javadoc-junit-project>>. The location of
  the produced xml files has to be specified in the text input box,
  which allows the use of patterns to find files in multiple sub
  folders of the project.In addition it is possible to retain the
  build log output by checking the Retain long standard output/error.

[[fig-post-build-actions-junit]]
.Configuring the JUnit test result report post build action
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-junit.png[scale=75]

Archive the artifacts::

  With this feature enabled Hudson will keep the specified artifacts
  and make them available on the web interface. Using a wildcard
  syntax in the Files to archive as well as the Excludes input boxes
  you can specify the artifacts that should be saved after each
  successful build.The artifacts of the last successful build are
  available on the project overview page as visible in
  <<fig-post-build-actions-archive-artifacts-project>>.

[[fig-post-build-actions-archive-artifacts]]
.Configuring the artifacts archival post build action

[[fig-post-build-actions-archive-artifacts-project]]
.A project overview page for the Hudson book project with the latest build artifact available for download
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-archive-artifacts-project.png[scale=75]

In addition <<fig-post-build-actions-archive-artifacts-build>> shows
how the artifacts produced by a specific build can be accessed on
build specific page.

[[fig-post-build-actions-archive-artifacts-build]]
.A build specific page for the Hudson book build with build artifact available for download
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-archive-artifacts-build.png[scale=75]

This feature is useful to make release artifacts like war, ear or zip
files available for retrieval by other users and for archival
purposes. Hudson can be used as the reference storage place for these
artifacts that are in turn used e.g. for QA and production deployments
or for distribution to customers.

If your artifacts are created by a Maven 3 based build using Maven 3
build steps, it might be a better option to activate the option
Archive Maven 3 artifacts for better archiving robustness as
documented above in the respective section.

Recording fingerprints of files to track usage::

  The feature to Record fingerprints of files to track usage can help
  you track down, where files are used and produced. It will allow you
  to determine the build number that created an artifact by looking at
  the fingerprint, which is a unique identifier for the file that
  Hudson creates and keep track of.

[[fig-post-build-actions-fingerprint]]
.Configuring the fingerprinting post build action
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-fingerprint.png[scale=75]

Build other projects::

  Building other projects after completion of the current project
  build, is one of the key features that allows you to set up chains
  of project builds. They can then all be small in focus and build
  time. However in the bigger picture you are able to to run a build
  for very large and complex systems. The input box Projects to build
  accepts a comma-separated list of projects to build together with a
  check box that allows you to trigger the dependent builds even if the
  current project build failed.

[[fig-post-build-actions-build-other]]
.Configuring downstream builds post build action
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-build-other.png[scale=75]


Some examples for the usage of this feature are a main project
triggering separate projects that invoke unit and/integration tests,
shared libraries invoking server as well as client side application
builds or build system plugin builds triggering all projects that use
the plugin.

E-mail Notification::

  A very valuable post-build action for a continuous integration build
  is the sending of build notification emails.  Hudson can be
  configured to send out build failure notices to any email
  address. In most instances it will be best to send the notices to an
  email list allowing the potential recipients to opt-in and out as
  well as access archives. This email is one of the primary ways in
  which developers are notified of build failures. To configure this
  feature, check the check box next to E-mail Notification and then
  specify the recipients email addresses in Recipients separated by
  whitespace. Selecting Send e-mail for every unstable build will
  instruct Hudson to send an email for each build even if a build
  experience consecutive failures. Selecting Send separate e-mails to
  individuals who broke the build will send email to all SCM
  committers that affected a build that broke. The email will be sent
  with the configuration specified in <<section-configure-email-notification>>.

[[fig-post-build-actions-email]]
.Configuring the email notification post build action
image::figs/web/post-build-actions-email.png[scale=75]

Notify that Maven dependencies have been updated::

  When activating this option Hudson will notify all projects with a
  build trigger configured to watch for Maven dependencies that have
  been updated (see <<section-configuring-build-triggers>>). When the
  additional option Notify even when build is unstable is selected
  this notification will occur even when an unstable build ran. A
  side-effect of this could be that only some Maven dependencies have
  been updated, which could lead to further failures of the dependent
  projects.

[[section-configuring-free-style-project]]
=== Configuring Free-style Projects

In addition to the common project configurations we discussed prior, a
free-style Hudson project has a section for the build definition that
allows you to add individual build steps. Press the Add build step
button in the Build configuration section to set up one or multiple
steps that define your build with the choices displayed in
<<fig-freestye-add-build-step>> and documented below.

[[fig-freestye-add-build-step]]
.Adding a free-style project build step
image::figs/web/freestyle-add-build-step.png[scale=75]

Execute shell::

  Executing a shell script as a build step is configured just like a
  Windows batch command. The unix convention to use the first line
  with a #! and the path to an executable allows you to write shell
  scripts in many available shell and scripting languages.

Invoke Maven 2 (Legacy)::

  A Maven 2 based build step can be configured as documented in
  <<section-maven-2-build-configuration>>. We recommend to use the
  Maven 3 invocation where possible.

Invoke Ant::

  Invoking an Ant target can be added just like a shell script task,
  but with more configuration options. Find out more on how to
  configure Ant invocations in <<section-ant-build-configuration>>

Execute Windows batch command::

  The Command input allows you to specify the the name of the batch
  file to execute. The script has to return an error level value of
  zero to be recognized as a build success by Hudson.  The script will
  be executed with the current workspace of the project as the
  directory. A number of environment variables about Hudson and the
  current project are passed to the execution of the script and can be
  used from within the script.

Invoke Maven 3::

  A Maven 3 based build step can be configured as documented in
  <<section-maven-3-build-configuration>>

[[chapter-maven]]
== Working with Apache Maven Builds

Apache Maven is the most widely used build tool for Java-based
applications and beyond. It has excellent support in Hudson and is
employed by most Hudson users.

[[section-installing-maven]]
=== Installing and Configuring Apache Maven

In order to use Apache Maven for your project build you will have to
configure one or more installs, as documented in
<<section-configure-maven>>. Among the many factors that influence
your choice of installation method you might want to consider the
following:

One or more Maven versions?::

  Depending on the variety of projects you aim to be building on
  Hudson, you might need to have more Maven versions for building your
  projects available. This can be helpful to allow for a staged
  upgrade with one project at a time to minimize down times due to
  broken builds with newer versions as well.

Variety of operating systems in build cluster::

  Your build cluster might be using different operating system
  versions, which can make some installation methods harder or
  impossible to use. Reasons for using different operating systems in
  a cluster can be the need to run tests on them, facilitating
  pre-existing e.g. desktop workstations at night, the need to build
  native packages on their own platform or simply the fact that a
  certain build can only be done on a specific operating system.

Control software via Hudson or something else?::

  While Hudson has built in support to manage the JDK install as well
  as Apache Ant and Maven, your builds can require any number of
  further software to work. If your build requires a high number of
  these additional software packages installed, it will be
  increasingly difficult to keep your build cluster setup configured
  with all required components. If you or someone else in your company
  already uses a provisioning software or virtual machine or operating
  system snapshots for similar purposes and it would make sense to
  reuse the existing facilities and setup. Otherwise it might be worth
  getting a provision system suitable to your needs set up.

Available expertise::

  Your team or yourself might have pre-existing expertise with native
  package management, provisioning software, virtual machine snapshots
  or Hudson itself that can be an influencing factor on how to set up
  your Maven installs.

Control Maven installation::

  Some installation methods like using a pre-existing Maven install
  from an operating system package rely on third parties to create
  these installations at first. While convenient this implies a loss
  of control that might not be desired and has to be weighed against
  the additional effort of different install methods.

With assessing these influencing parameters you will be able to derive
a strategy for your Maven install(s), that will work across the
different machines in your build cluster and for all your
projects. This strategy can potentially involve different installation
methods. When using the recommended Maven 3 integration no Maven
install is necessary, since a Maven 3 install is embedded with the
plugin. Otherwise a minimal setup of one Maven install can be used to
set up your first project, that is built with Maven on Hudson.

=== Selecting Components of your Maven and Hudson Integration

The recommended way to configure a Maven build on Hudson is to create
a free-style software project as documented in
<<chapter-build-creation>> and then creating one or more build steps
that Invoke Maven 3. More details on the specific configuration
options and more can be found in <<section-maven-3-build-configuration>>.

If you require Maven 2 for your build for some legacy reason, even
though Maven 3 is a higher performing, drop-in replacement you can
fall back to using the Invoke Maven 2 (Legacy) build step documented
in <<section-maven-2-build-configuration>>. Even though this option
exists, we recommend moving forward and migrating to Maven 3 and the
Maven 3 build step.

Finally your Hudson install may contain a separate project type
labeled Build a Maven 2/3 project (Legacy) available when creating a
new project. This feature has numerous issues with the use of
different Maven versions and use cases, especially Maven 3, and is not
supported in Hudson. We recommend not to use this job type.  If you do
not need this job type anymore after migrating to the Maven 3 build
step and want to avoid the accidental creation of projects with this
type, you should disable the +Hudson:: Maven(legacy) :: Plugin+.  Read more
about managing your plugins in <<chapter-plugin-management>>.

Both the Maven 2/3 project type as well as the Maven 2 build step are
part of Hudson as legacy components and are not the focus of active
development and improvements. If your existing jobs use either of
these we recommend migrating to Maven 3 build step based free-style
projects.

In order to be able to keep existing legacy build around without
cluttering to user interface or have inexperienced users create builds
with the legacy systems, you can enable the blacklist plugin to
disable certain views within Hudson without completely disabling the
still required plugins.

=== Details of Configuring Maven 3 Build Options

After configuring the general project options as documented in
<<chapter-build-creation>>, you can configure one or more build
steps. To add a build step, click on the Add build step button as
shown in <<fig-maven-3-build-step-default>>. To configure a Maven build,
select Invoke Maven 3.

The basic and advanced options for configuring a Maven 3 build steps
are shown in <<fig-maven-3-build-step-default>> and
<<fig-maven-3-build-step-advanced>> . When adding a new Maven 3 build
step all parameters are pre-populated with the default parameters
defined for Maven 3 build steps. These are configured in the global
Hudson configuration documented in <<chapter-configuration>> in
<<section-configure-maven-3-builder-defaults>>.

.Configuring a Maven 3 Build Step - Advanced Options
image::figs/web/build-step-maven-3-advanced.png[scale=75]

Maven Version::

  Your Hudson installation may have one or more Maven 3 installations
  configured as part of the global Hudson configuration.  This
  drop-down allows you to specify the version of Maven 3 to use with
  the current build step. By default the Maven 3 integration will use
  a bundled version of Maven 3, that is installed as part of the Maven
  3 integration itself.

Goals::

  This field allows you to specify the goals and phases you would like
  to use for the Maven 3 invocation, separate by spaces and in order
  of desired invocation just like you would use Maven 3 on the
  command-line. Typically these would be +clean install+, but
  depending on your project and build step others may apply. The
  plugin with automatically show the Maven version and operate in
  batch mode equivalent to the +-V+ and +-B+ options. It is also to
  specify other specific Maven to command-line options like +-P+ for
  profile selection, selection of a specific +settings.xml+ file, +-X+
  for debugging logging and so on. However this is not recommended
  since there are specific configuration settings for most parameters
  in the Advanced section. If you specify them in their dedicated
  option it will be easier to carry out programmatic changes e.g. via
  scripts in the Hudson console across all projects defined in your
  Hudson instance.

Properties::

  You can pass one or more properties to the Maven process. This field
  accepts a list of properties with lines in a key=value format. These
  properties will be passed into the Maven build step invocation using
  the standard way of passing properties of -Dkey1=value1
  -Dkey2=value2.  

POM File::

  If your project uses the standard +pom.xml+ filename, there is no
  need to specify a POM. If your project uses a POM with an
  alternative name or path other than directly in the project root,
  you can specify that file name and path here. This setting is
  equivalent to the command-line option -f pomfilepath or--file
  pomfilepath. The path specified has to be relative to the project
  root. It is also necessary to specify the path to the POM file here
  if you SCM setup causes the POM file to be located in a sub-folder
  and not in the top level workspace folder.

Private repository::

  By default a Maven invocation will use a private repository in the
  project workspace in a +.maven/repo+ folder. This ensures that other
  project builds do not have any side effects. However it can cause
  considerable usage of storage space, which consequently should be
  monitored carefully. If this option is disabled the standard Maven
  repository location in the current users home directory will be
  used. The user will the operating system user running Hudson and
  therefore invoking Maven 3 via the plugin.

Private temporary directory::

  When this option is activated the java environment variable 
  +java.io.tmpdir+ will be set to a folder +.maven/tmp+ in the
  project-specific workspace. This is useful when your build accesses
  the temporary directory for storage of artifacts or any temporary
  files e.g. used while running tests. When using the option with
  builds that produce large amounts of data in the temporary folder it
  is important to monitor the size of the folder and potentially add a
  clean up routine to the host operating system regular scheduled
  jobs.

Offline::

  Activating this option causes Maven to be run with the +-o+ offline
  option enabled and it will therefore not access any remote
  repositories.  

Profiles::

  Adding a comma or space separated list of profile names causes the
  Maven 3 integration to pass them to the invocation with the +-P+
  parameter.

Show Errors::

  Enabling the Show Errors option is equivalent to use the +-e+
  command-line parameter, which will cause Maven to output any errors
  in the console.

Verbosity::

  Configure the verbosity of the log output to the console by Maven to
  be at normal, quiet or debug levels. These levels are equivalent to
  no option and the +-q+ and +-X+ options for Maven command-line
  invocation.

Checksum Mode::

  Configure the strictness of the checksum validation when downloading
  artifacts from repositories to be at normal, lax or strict
  levels. These levels are equivalent to no option and the +-c+ and
  +-C+ options for Maven command-line invocation.

Snapshot Updates::

  The Snapshot Updates option provides control over the way Maven
  treats +SNAPSHOT+ artifacts. The NORMAL activates the standard Maven
  behavior, where as FORCE and SUPPRESS will activate the +-U+ and
  +-nsu+ options.

Recursive::

  Just like for normal Maven invocation this option is activated by
  default, which means that nested modules in a multi-module project
  will be build. Deactivating this feature is equivalent to the
  non-recursive command-line option +-N+.

Projects::

  The Projects option allows you to specify the projects that should
  be added to the reactor during build. You can either specify them by
  the relative path in your project workspace or by +artifactId+ and
  optionally +groupId+ in a +groupId:artifactId+ format. The
  equivalent command-line option is +-pl+.

Resume From::

  The Resume From uses the same syntax as the Projects and sets the
  +-rf+ command-line option to resume the build from the specified
  artifact.

Fail Mode::

  The Fail Mode option supports the modes NORMAL, FAST, AT_END and
  NEVER that determine how your Maven build proceeds in case of any
  failures. The equivalent command-line options are no option, +-ff+,
  +-fae+ and +-fn+. This can have considerable impact on the load on
  your Hudson server e.g. by not proceeding past failed tests but
  instead failing the build so that developer can fix it before a long
  running build needs to be kicked off again.

Make Mode::

  The Make Mode option can be used to enable Make-like build behavior
  of Maven. The options are the default behavior equivalent to NONE
  and DEPENDENCIES, DEPENDENTS and BOTH respectively +-am+, +-amd+ and
  +-am -amd+.

////
    TODO add URL to external resource explaining this more and explain
     how this can work with a project in relation to checked out
     workspace project and external dependencies, also how does this
     work with Hudson upstream, downstream dependencies and so on
////

Threading::

  This input takes the value for the +-T+ command-line option that
  enables the experimental support for parallel builds in Maven 3. A
  value of +4+ enables four threads for the build. A value of +2.5C+
  would enable 2.5 threads per CPU core. When activating this feature,
  keep the experimental nature of this feature as well as the not yet
  wide spread support for this feature in the various plugins in mind. Read
  https://cwiki.apache.org/MAVEN/parallel-builds-in-maven-3.html[on the Maven Wiki]
  to find out more about this feature and the current status.

Settings::

  This option corresponds to the +-s+ command-line option for Maven 3
  and supplies a Maven 3 build step with a custom settings
  configuration file. The drop down for this field is populated with
  the Maven 3 Settings files configured in the Hudson Maven 3
  Configuration page as shown in <<fig-manage-mvn-3-settings>>.

Global Settings::

  This option corresponds to the +-gs+ command-line option for Maven
  and isn't used as frequently as the +-s+ option. This option allows
  you to reference a custom global configuration file that is an
  alternative to the global settings file that ships with Apache
  Maven.

Tool Chains::

  Tool chains for Maven 3 build steps can be configured globally for
  your Hudson install as documented in
  <<section-configure-maven-3-configuration>>. The drop allows you to
  select one of these configured tool chains for to be used for the
  build step. Tool chains are a very useful, but lesser known feature
  of Maven and more documentation can be found in the
  http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html[mini
  guide on the Apache web site].

JVM Options::

  If your build requires specific JVM options, they can be set in this
  field. The options are passed straight through as MAVEN_OPTS and use
  the normal java command-line options syntax. A common configuration
  for complex builds is to specify a larger memory for the JVM running
  Maven via -Xmx1024m.

[[section-maven-2-build-configuration]]
=== Details of Configuring Maven 2 (Legacy) Build Options

If for some reason you are still using Maven 2 and cannot upgrade to
Maven 3 and therefore take advantage of the advanced performance and
features of Maven 3 and the Maven 3 integration of Hudson offers you,
you should use the Maven 2 (Legacy) integration in a free-style
project build step. After configuring the general project options (see
<<chapter-build-creation>>), you can configure one or more build
steps. To add a build step, click on the Add build step button as
shown in <<fig-build-step-maven-2-legacy-default>>. To configure a
Maven build, select Invoke Maven 2 (Legacy).

[[fig-build-step-maven-2-legacy-default]]
.Configuring Project Build Options
image::figs/web/build-step-maven-2-legacy-default.png[scale=75]

The basic and advanced options for invoking a Maven 2 (Legacy) target
are shown in <<fig-build-step-maven-2-legacy-advanced>>.

[[fig-build-step-maven-2-legacy-advanced]]
.Advanced Configuration of a Maven 2 (Legacy) Build Step
image::figs/web/build-step-maven-2-legacy-advanced.png[scale=75]

Maven Version::

  Your Hudson installation may have one or more Maven installations
  configured as part of the global Hudson configuration.  This
  drop-down allows you to specify the version of Maven for usage with
  the current build step.

Goals::

  This field allows you to specify the command-line parameters used
  for the Maven invocation. These are phases, plugin goals as well as
  specific Maven command-line options like +-P+ for profile selection,
  selection of a specific +settings.xml+ file and so on.  

POM::

  If your project uses the standard +pom.xml+ filename, there is no
  need to specify a POM. If your project uses a POM with an
  alternative name or path other than directly in the project root,
  you can specify that file name and path here. This setting is
  equivalent to the command-line option -f pomfilepath or--file
  pomfilepath. The path specified has to be relative to the project
  root.

Properties::

  You can pass one or more properties to the Maven process. This field
  accepts a list of properties with lines in a key=value format. These
  properties will be passed into the Maven build step invocation using
  the standard way of passing properties of -Dkey1=value1
  -Dkey2=value2.  

JVM Options::

  If your build requires specific JVM options, they can be set in this
  field. The options are passed straight through as MAVEN_OPTS and use
  the normal java command-line options syntax. A common configuration
  for complex builds is to specify a larger memory for the JVM running
  Maven via -Xmx1024m.

Use private Maven repository::

  By default a Maven invocation will use a local repository in the
  current users home directory taking any further repository
  configuration done in settings.xml into account. Depending on the
  necessary separation of the different jobs running on Hudson it can
  be useful to have a separate Maven repository for each
  project. Activating this feature will cause the creation of a
  separate Maven repository in a +.repository+ folder in the projects
  workspace. This can cause considerable usage of storage space, which
  consequently should be monitored carefully.

The standard way of invoking a Maven build is to run the clean and
install life cycle phases in a command-line call like mvn clean
install. This can be easily achieved by adding a Maven build step and
adding clean install as a Goals parameter. If so desired these two
life cycle phases can also be invoked separately by creating two Maven
build steps with separate clean and install parameters. This would
cause two separate invocations of Maven in sequence equivalent to mvn
clean; mvn install Breaking up the invocations allows you to add
further build steps in between and build an arbitrarily complex
sequence of Maven and other invocations with completely separate
parameters and so on.

You could for example slip a plugin goal invocation in between the
clean and install invocations, that prepares the execution environment
for your build for example by setting up a test environment like an
emulator or a specific database and content. Since you can do this in
a separate build step you can invoke a shell script or an Ant target
for such tasks, in case it is not automated via a Maven plugin or
configuration.

== Working with Apache Ant Builds

[[section-installing-ant]]
=== Installing Apache Ant for Hudson

The general configuration for Apache Ant installs on Hudson is
available in <<section-configure-ant>>. You can read about influencing
factors for your Apache Maven install, that apply to your strategy for
installing Ant as well in <<section-installing-maven>>.

A common scenario for Apache Ant installs is the requirement of a
build to have access to Ant tasks as provided in
http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net[Ant-Contrib] like For or If or to
have some required libraries like http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/[JSch]
for secure copying with scp available on the Ant classpath. Custom
developed Ant tasks can be needed in a similar fashion. A convenient
way to achieve this, is the creation of a custom archive containing
the Ant install as well as additional libraries necessary. This
archive can then be used with the Extract from *.zip/*.tar.gz option
to get a fully working Ant and dependencies installed on all build
cluster nodes.

[[section-ant-build-configuration]]
=== Configuring Apache Ant Builds

After configuring the general project options as documented in
<<chapter-build-creation>>, you can configure one or more build
steps. To add a build step, click on the Add build step button and
select Invoke Ant.

The basic and advanced options for invoking Ant are shown in
<<fig-configure-ant-build-step>>.

[[fig-configure-ant-build-step]]
.Configuring an Ant Build Steps
image::figs/web/configure-ant-build-step.png[scale=75]

Ant Version::

  Your Hudson installation may have one or more Ant installations
  configured as part of the global Hudson configuration. This
  drop-down allows you to specify the version of Ant for usage with
  the current build step.

Targets::

  This field allows you to specify the command-line parameters used
  for the Ant invocation. These are all options and targets supported
  by the specified Ant and the current Build File. If nothing is
  specified in this field, the build step will invoke Ant without
  parameters. With a default target specified in the build file, this
  can be sufficient for a full build depending on your build file.

Build File::

  If your project uses the standard +build.xml+ filename, there is no
  need to specify a Build File If your project uses a build file with
  an alternative name or path other than directly in the project root,
  you can specify that file name and path here. This setting is
  equivalent to the command line option -f buildfilepath. The path
  specified has to be relative to the project root.

Properties::

  You can pass one or more properties to the Ant process. This field
  accepts a list of properties with lines in a key=value format. These
  properties will be passed into the Ant build step invocation using
  the standard way of passing properties of -Dkey1=value1
  -Dkey2=value2.

Java Options::

  If your build requires specific Java options, they can be set in
  this field. The options are passed straight through as ANT_OPTS and
  use the normal java command-line options syntax. A common
  configuration for complex builds is to specify a larger memory for
  the JVM running Ant via -Xmx1024m.

[[chapter-source-control]]
== Working with Source Control

One of the most important parts of the Hudson project configuration
are the settings that connect your Hudson project to source
control. Any software development project should be managed in a
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_management[source control management system],
many of which are open source
software and have large user communities. Hudson has support for all
common SCM systems as well as many of the less popular ones. Most
likely you will find support for your SCM already installed or
available as a plugin for installation in the Source Code Management
section of available plugins in the plugin management as displayed
in<<fig-scm-plugins>>. Read more about available plugins and their
management in <<section-plugin-management-available>> 
in <<chapter-plugin-management>>.

[[fig-scm-plugins]]
.The beginning of the list of Source Code Management plugins
image::figs/web/scm-plugins.png[scale=75]

By default Hudson has support for Git, Subversion and CVS
pre-installed.  This chapter will document usage of the respective
Hudson plugins as well as the plugin supporting the popular open
source SCM system Mercurial.

Each of these plugins can be configured in the global Hudson
configuration setting in its specific section added by the plugin.

After the global settings for the desired source management system are
configured, you can configure the project-specific settings. Simply
load the project's configuration page and scroll down to the Source
Code Management section. In this section, you must then select one of
the radio buttons for the source code management system you are using
as visible in <<fig-scm-selection>>

[[fig-scm-selection]]
.Selecting an SCM in the project configuration
image::figs/web/scm-selection.png[scale=75]

After this selection you will be able to configure the parameters
specific to the selected SCM and the current project.

[[section-scm-svn]]
=== Configuring Subversion

The Subversion Plugin for Hudson and therefore support for the popular
http://subversion.tigris.org/[Subversion SCM system] is part of the
default install of Hudson. It is therefore not necessary to perform
any further plugin installation to use Subversion for your project.

[[section-scm-svn-global]]
==== Global Subversion Configuration

In order to use Subversion successfully, you need to set up the global
configuration in the Hudson Server configuration screen displayed in
<<fig-scm-svn-global-config>>.

[[fig-scm-svn-global-config]]
.Global Subversion Configuration
image::figs/web/scm-svn-global-config.png[scale=75]

The following parameters need to be configured as desired:

Subversion Workspace Version::

  Subversion uses different formats for storing data in a checked out
  location. Ideally you should have the same Subversion version
  installed on the SCM server as well as on the Hudson server and
  specify that version here. If your Hudson project tasks only require
  read access to the Subversion repository it is safe to use a higher
  version on the Hudson server and specify it here. However if you are
  automating a release process or any other tasks that will write to
  the Subversion repository e.g. by creating tags or branches or
  editing files and checking them in, you should make sure to use the
  same format on the Hudson server as on the Subversion server since
  mismatches can produce problems in the Subversion repository and
  potentially break expected behavior. An important issue related to
  this setup is that you can not support different Subversion servers
  with different versions accessed from one Hudson instance. It is
  advisable to update the Subversion servers and Hudson installed
  clients before proceeding.

Subversion Revision Policy::

  The default revision policy is +Queue time+, which will cause a
  build to be run off the revision present in the repository when the
  job is added to the Hudson build queue. The +Build time+ policy one
  the other hand will use the revision in the repository found when
  the build actually starts . The +Head revision+ policy will use the
  HEAD revision in the repository. Finally these settings are
  overridden if a revision is specified in the subversion url or as a
  revision parameter in a parameterized build.

Exclusion revprop name::

  This parameter can be used to cause the plugin to exclude revisions
  with the specified revision property from triggering new
  builds. This is useful for builds that cause a commit so that this
  commit done by Hudson will not in turn trigger the execution of
  another build. The commits carried out by Hudson as part of the
  build have to be configured to use the same property.

Validate repository URLs up to the first variable name::

  With this setting activated subversion urls will only be validated
  up to the first variable. A variable in a url would be preceded by a
  +$+ character.

[[section-scm-svn-project]]
==== Project-Specific Subversion Configuration

Selecting Subversion under the Source Code Management section will
display the configuration options shown
in <<fig-scm-svn-project-config>>.  Clicking
on the Advanced button will reveal the advanced configuration
parameters shown in <<fig-scm-svn-project-config-advanced>>.

[[fig-scm-svn-project-config]]
.Configuring project-specific Subversion settings

[[fig-scm-svn-project-config-advanced]]
.Configuring advanced project-specific Subversion settings
image::figs/web/scm-svn-project-config-advanced.png[scale=75]

The following parameters can be configured:

Modules::

  Hudson can check out one or more Subversion modules from a
  Subversion repository. To configure a repository location, supply a
  Subversion URL in the Repository URL text field. This field supports
  Subversion repository URLs including revisions specified with
  +@number+ as well as subversion keywords for revisions and
  dates. The link Update credentials navigates you to the SVN
  authentication screen documented below.
+
  If you are checking out more than one Subversion module, you can
  also supply a Local module directory that Hudson will check out the
  specified module to. If you leave the Local module directory blank,
  Hudson will check out the specific module to the root of the
  project's workspace.
+
  The Repository depth option allows you to specify the depth for the
  checkout of this module, with the default being+infinity+, which
  means that all nested directories of the repository will be checked
  out.  This is useful to limit the size and scope of your checkout.
+
  You can add a new module with the Add more locations button and
  remove it with the Delete button.

Check-out Strategy::

  The Check-out Strategy option determines the subversion commands
  issues prior to starting a build.
+
  The default value of Use 'svn update' as much as possible will cause
  the least load on the Subversion server by only issuing an update
  command on top of the existing checkout in the project workspace.
+
  The option Use 'svn update' as much as possible, with 'svn revert'
  before update will do minor cleanup of the workspace by reverting
  any local modifications.
+
  The option Emulate clean checkout by first deleting
  unversioned/ignored files, then 'svn update' provides a good
  compromise between performance and thoroughness, since it closely
  resembles a clean checkout without the performance and load
  implications for the Subversion server as well as Hudson.
+
  Finally the option Always check out a fresh copy will delete the
  workspace content and perform a fresh checkout for each
  build. Choosing this option should be considered carefully since it
  can put a significant load on the Subversion and Hudson servers.

Repository Browser::

  Hudson supplies valuable information about a build and about the SCM
  activity and changes that contribute to a specific build.  When
  Hudson displays information about a Subversion commit or a file that
  has been modified, it can be configured to link to a Repository
  browser, which provides a rich web view of the source code
  repository. Hudson supports the repository browsers CollabNet,
  Sventon 2.x, ViewSVN, FishEye, WebSVN and Sventon 1.x as options in
  the the drop-down.  The (Auto) option will attempt to automatically
  detect the used browser.

You can navigate to the Subversion Authentication screen by clicking
the Update credentials link, which will display as visible in
<<fig-scm-svn-project-authentication>>.

[[fig-scm-svn-project-authentication]]
.Configuring subversion authentication Subversion settings
image::figs/web/scm-svn-project-authentication.png[scale=75]

The subversion plugin can be configured to use authentication with:

User name/password authentication::

  Provide the user name and password in the supplied input fields.

SSH public key authentication (svn+ssh)::

  The Private Key control allows you to upload a key file for which
  you can provide the User name in the respective input field. If you
  key is encrypted with a password you need to add it in the Pass
  phrase input.

HTTPS client certificate::

  For HTTPS based authentication you can upload a Public Key
  Cryptography 12 (PKCS12) file and provide a password in the provided
  controls.

By default the above configuration will override any global
configuration. This behavior can be deactivated by selecting no in
the Override global credentials option.

Beyond these basic configuration options the Subversion plugin
supports advanced options to provide more parameters to your
Subversion commands used for the build.

Excluded Regions, Included Regions::

  These fields provide you with the option to either specifically
  include or exclude files and directories to determine if a build
  should be triggered. If Included Regions is set, Hudson will only
  trigger a build if a matching file has been altered. If Excluded
  Regions is set, Hudson will not trigger a build if a file matching
  an excluded pattern is matched. These options are useful if you are
  only interested in a subset of files and directories contained in a
  Subversion module to trigger a build on Hudson. An example would be
  if documentation files contained in the repository should not
  trigger a new build.

Both parameters support usage of regular expression patterns to
specify the desired files as well as multiple lines to configure
larger sets of files and directories to match.

Excluded Users::

  If this field is populated and Hudson is configured to poll
  subversion as a build trigger, Hudson will not trigger builds for
  commits from the specified users. This can be used to avoid builds
  to be triggered by commits done by Hudson or other systems that
  commit changes that should not trigger a build.

Excluded Commit Messages::

  Similar to the option Exclude users this field contains a regular
  expression and will cause Hudson not to trigger a build for commits
  with a matching commit message.

Exclusion revprop name::

  A Subversion revision can be associated with a property. If Hudson
  encounters a revision with the specified property, it will not
  trigger a build from an SCM commit, similar to the behavior for the
  options Excluded Users or Excluded Commit Messages

[[section-scm-svn-basic-config]]
==== Minimal Basic SVN Configuration

In order to build a project controlled in subversion you only need to
configure the repository url in the project configuration using an url
available for anonymous read access to the repository.

==== Subversion related environment variables

The subversion plugin exports the following environment variables for
your usage in build scripts and others:

SVN_REVISION::

  The repository revision.

SVN_URL::

  The url used to access the repository.

If multiple modules are defined these environment variables get and
index appended in to their names and all revisions and urls of the
modules will be exported as +SVN_REVISION_1+, +SVN_REVISION_2+,
+SVN_REVISION_n+ and +SVN_URL_1+, +SVN_URL_2+, +SVN_URL_n+.

[[section-scm-git]]
=== Configuring Git

http://git-scm.com/[Git] is the most successful, modern distributed
version control system and has gained wide acceptance in the open
source community and beyond. and repository hosting services available
from multiple suppliers for commercial and open source usage.

The Hudson Git Plugin and therefore support for Git is available in
default Hudson installs from version 2.1 onwards. If it is not
installed in your Hudson instance, simply find the plugin in the
Source Code Management section of the available plugins and install it
like any other plugins as documented in <<chapter-plugin-management>>.

[[section-scm-git-global]]
==== Global Git Configuration

The global configuration for using Git is set up in the Git section of
the Hudson Server configuration screen as displayed in
<<fig-scm-git-global-config>>.

[[fig-scm-git-global-config]]
.Configuring Git Installations
image::figs/web/scm-git-global-config.png[scale=75]

Name::

  A name for your Git installation can be specified to distinguish
  between multiple installs.

Path to git executable::

  If the git command is available on the operating system PATH or the
  PATH for the user running Hudson, you can simply specify
  +git+. Otherwise an absolute path can be used as well.
+
  In addition to using an already installed git, the Git plugin
  facilitates the tool installer from Hudson that allows Run Command
  and Extract from *.zip/*.tar.gz based installs similar to the JDK
  installs documented in details in <<section-configure-jdk>>. The Ant
  and the Maven plugins installers described in
  <<section-configure-ant>> and <<section-configure-maven>> use the
  same installers and you can find more hints of its usage there.
+
  A further global configuration for git can be done in the Git plugin
  section displayed in<<fig-scm-git-global-user-config>>.  Specifying
  Global Config user.name Value and Global Config user.email Value
  values will cause the plugin to issue git config commands setting
  these options for each project that is configured to use git. The
  specific project configuration allows you to override these setting
  for each project individually.

<<fig-scm-git-project-config>>.

[[fig-scm-git-project-config]]
.Basic Git source control information
image::figs/web/scm-git-project-config.png[scale=75]

The section shown in <<fig-scm-git-project-config>> contains the
following options for the basic configuration of git in your project
configuration:

Repositories::

  Specifying one or more repositories to access for your project can
  be considered the main configuration of the git details for your
  project. The minimum configuration is to provide a valid value for
  URL of repository.  The typical protocols +http://+, +ssh://+ and
  +git://+ are all supported. Advanced configuration as displayed in
  <<fig-scm-git-project-config-repository>> allows you to provide a
  name of the repository as well as a refspec.  Providing multiple
  repositories only makes sense when they are clones or instances off
  the same repository, since they will be used for merging together
  the content prior to the build.

Branches to build::

  In this section you can specify one or more branches that should be
  built. The default of an empty branch specifier causes the git
  plugin to track all branches and build the latest changed branch.
+
  A common configuration would be to specify the main branch in the
  repository e.g. +master+.  This would ensure that the build is only
  triggered for changes committed to master. If you want to have other
  branches built as well it is advisable to create separate Hudson
  projects for the different branches.
+
  The advanced usage of this feature would be to specify multiple
  branches. These branches would be used for a merge prior to a build
  and could be configured to push the merge result back to the remote
  repository after a successful build.

Repository browser::

  The default Auto option will cause the plugin to attempt to detect a
  web-based user interface to access the git repository. Selecting one
  of the supported repository browsers gitweb, redmineweb and
  githubweb lets you provide a base url to the repository
  browser. With the browser url specified the changes view of each
  build will have added links to the repository.

[[fig-scm-git-project-config-repository]]
.Configuring repository specific Git configuration
image::figs/web/scm-git-project-config-repository.png[scale=75]

In many use cases you will be able to configure everything necessary
with regards to git using the basic configuration options documented
above. For more complex cases the plugin provides various advanced
parameters as displayed in <<fig-scm-git-project-config-advanced>>,
which become accessible by pressing the Advanced button and documented
below.ex

[[fig-scm-git-project-config-advanced]]
.Configuring advanced Git configuration
image::figs/web/scm-git-project-config-advanced.png[scale=75]

Excluded Regions::

  This configuration allows you to specifically exclude files and
  directories to determine if a build should be triggered. If set,
  Hudson will not trigger a build if only files and directories
  matching the patterns have been changed. This option is useful if
  you are only interested in a subset of files and directories
  contained in a Git repository to trigger a build on Hudson. An
  example would be if documentation files contained in the repository
  should not trigger a new build.
+
  The configuration supports usage of regular expression patterns to
  specify the desired files as well as multiple lines to configure
  larger sets of files and directories to match.

Excluded Users::

  If this field is populated and Hudson is configured to poll git as a
  build trigger, Hudson will not trigger builds for commits from the
  specified users. This can be used to avoid builds to be triggered by
  commits done by Hudson or other systems that commit changes that
  should not trigger a build.

Checkout/merge to local branch (optional)::

  Supplying a value here causes git to create a local branch to
  checkout to. All the branches specified in the configuration above
  would be merged into that local branch.

Local subdirectory for repo (optional)::

  You can specify the name of the subdirectory to checkout a git
  project to. If you omit this subdirectory, the git repository will
  be checked out into the workspace directory.

Config user.name Value::

  This option allows you to cause git to set the +user.name+ property
  prior to checkout and build. It overrides the global git
  configuration of the same property

Config user.email Value::

  This option allows you to cause git to set the +user.email+ property
  prior to checkout and build. It overrides the global git
  configuration of the same property

Merge options::

  When you activate the option Merge before build the configuration
  parameters displayed in <<fig-scm-git-project-config-adv-merge>>
  become accessible. This powerful option can be used to specify a
  repository to merge from in Name of repository . The content of the
  repository will be merged to the branch specified in Branch to merge
  to and if the operation succeeds the build will proceed. The merge
  can then be pushed back to the remote repository by configuring a
  Git publisher post build action as documented in
  <<section-scm-git-project-publisher>>

[[fig-scm-git-project-config-adv-merge]]
.Configuring Git merge options
image::figs/web/scm-git-project-config-adv-merge.png[scale=75]

Prune remote branches before build::

  Selecting this option will cause the build to run the command git
  remote prune before each build . This is especially useful if remote
  branches are created and removed regularly allowing the local
  checkout in Hudson to stay in sync and only build the branches that
  also exist remotely.

Skip internal tag::

  Selecting this option will cause Hudson to omit the tagging of the
  local repository after each checkout, which performed by default.

Clean after checkout::

  This option causes git to remove all untracked files after each
  checkout and prior to the build.

Recursively update submodules::

  With this option selected and a new enough Git version installed
  submodules will be updated as part of the update prior to building.

Use commit author in changelog::

  Selecting this option changes the display of the changelog to show
  the commits +author+, rather than the default +committer+.

Wipe out workspace before build::

  This option will cause a complete wipe of the workspace prior to
  each build. Use caution when activating this option since it can
  have a significant impact on data transfer and time for the checkout
  and therefore build. For Maven projects it potentially wipes the
  local repository as well causing further increases in build
  time. The other options for keeping the workspace cleaned documented
  above are more advisable to be used in most cases.

Choosing strategy::

  This drop down will have only a Default option available with a
  default Hudson install. It determines which revision of the
  specified repositories and branches to build. For one branch and one
  repository HEAD will be built.  For multiple branches and
  repositories a more refined strategy is used selecting revisions
  that have not yet been built and are on the specified branches.
  Other plugins can implement a different choosing strategy e.g. the
  http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/Gerrit+Plugin[Gerrit Plugin]
  enables a Gerrit change set based strategy effectively allowing
  verified, pre-tested commits.

Git executable::

  This drop-down allows you to select a specific git executable used
  for all operations on this project's build.  Configuration of the
  executables is documented in <<section-scm-git-global>>.

[[section-scm-git-project-publisher]]
==== Configuring the post-build action Git Publisher

The git plugin adds the post build action Git Publisher as displayed
in <<fig-scm-git-project-pub>> to the project-specific
configuration. It can be used to push merges done prior to the build
back out to a remote repository after a build.

[[fig-scm-git-project-pub]]
.Configuring Git merge options
image::figs/web/scm-git-project-pub.png[scale=75]

Push Only If Build Succeeds::

  Selecting this option will cause Hudson to skip publishing any
  changes via push if the build failed.

Merge Results::

  With this option activated Hudson will push any merge results done
  prior to the build back to the remote origin.

Tags::

  The Add Tag button allows you to configure one or more tags to push
  to and potentially create.

Branches::

  The Add Branch button allows you to configure one or more branch and
  remote combinations to push to.

When configuring the Git Publisher you can specify Tags in fields
displayed in <<fig-scm-git-project-pub-tags>>.

[[fig-scm-git-project-pub-tags]]
.Configuring Git merge options
image::figs/web/scm-git-project-pub-tags.png[scale=75]

Tag to push::

  This input allows you to provide the name for the tag to use. It
  supports the expansion of environment variables as part of the tag
  name using the ${key} syntax. An example would be to use
  +Hudson-Build-${BUILD_NUMBER}+ to create a tag called
  e.g. Hudson-Build-123. Read <<section-configure-global-properties>>
  for more information about defining properties and available
  predefined ones.

Create new tag::

  This check box determines if the tag to push to as provided above
  should be created as a new tag or be used as an existing tag.

Target remote name::

  The name of the remote to push the tag to. The name needs to be
  configured as a repository in the SCM section for this project.
+
  Configuring branches to push to is done in the user interface
  displayed in <<fig-scm-git-project-pub-branches>>.

[[fig-scm-git-project-pub-branches]]
.Configuring Git merge options
image::figs/web/scm-git-project-pub-branches.png[scale=75]

Branch to push::

  This parameter specifies the branch the changes get push to after
  the build completes.

Target remote name::

  The Target remote name specifies the remote repository to which a
  push will be done and needs to be one of the names configured as a
  repository in the SCM section

[[section-scm-git-basic-config]]
==== Minimal Basic Git Configuration

In order to build a project controlled in git you need to have a git
installation configured in the global configuration.

In terms of project specific configuration you only need to specify
the public url of the repository. We recommend to specify the branch
to build as well since the default setup without a branch specified
will examine all branches in the repository and build the latest
changed branch. In a normal project this might adversely affect the
stability of the build and potentially cause a confusing history for
the project. We suggest to set up separate projects for each branch
you want to track and build on Hudson.

==== Multiple branches and automated merging

The recommended basic usage with the git plugin is to configure the
project branch for the build e.g. +master+, which will be
automatically configured if the field is left blank.  Alternative you
can specifiy a different branch name or use +**+. This option causes
all branches to be monitored for changes and the branch with the last
changes will be built.

This will cause your project build history to be comprised of builds
from all the different branches individually in the order of changes
received and potentially even omit builds if changes hit multiple
branches between builds.

However together with configuring Merge Options it allows for a
automated merge from whichever branch to have the latest changes to
the target branch e.g. +master+ and proceed with the build after the
merge.

Now you can activate the Git Publisher post-build action Push Only If
Build Succeeds and Merge Results to have the remote repository updated
with the successful merge results.

This approach can be configured with specific branches rather than the
default empty specification of branches to have better control of the
source branches to merge from. It can also be combined with multiple
repositories to pull changes in from.

[[section-scm-hg]]
=== Configuring Mercurial

http://mercurial.selenic.com/[Mercurial], also known as hg, is a
successful, modern distributed version control system and has gained
wide acceptance in the open source community and beyond used for large
projects like OpenJDK and Netbeans and repository hosting services
available from multiple suppliers for commercial and open source
usage.

The Hudson Mercurial Plugin and therefore support for Mercurial needs
to be installed on your Hudson instance. Simply find the plugin in the
Source Code Management section of the available plugins and install it
like any other plugins as documented in <<chapter-plugin-management>>.

[[section-scm-hg-global]]
==== Global Mercurial Configuration

To configure Mercurial, find the Mercurial section in the Hudson
Server configuration screen as displayed in
<<fig-scm-hg-global-config>>, press the Add and configure the
parameters for your Mercurial install. If Mercurial is already
installed on your Hudson server and the hg is available on the path,
you do not need to configure a Mercurial installation. The plugin will
pick up the installed version.

[[fig-scm-hg-global-config]]
.Configuring Mercurial Installations
image::figs/web/scm-hg-global-config.png[scale=75]

Name::

  The Name will be displayed in the drop down to select your Mercurial
  install in the project configuration. Use a name that includes the
  version to be able to identify the Mercurial install you desire to
  use in the project configuration, especially when using multiple
  installs.

Installation directory::

  Specify the absolute path to the Mercurial installation .

Executable::

  This is the path to the actual +hg+ executable. The field is
  pre-filled with +INSTALLATION/bin/hg+, which is the correct value if
  you use a manual install of hg.  If you are using binary package as
  provided by your operating system package management system the
  correct value is likely just +hg+, since the command would be on the
  +PATH+. Another common option is the absolute path of the executable
  e.g. +/usr/bin/hg+.

Use Repository Caches::

  Enabling this option triggers the Mercurial plugin to establish a
  repository cache on the Hudson master that will be used by the slave
  nodes as well. This considerably improves performance and reduces
  load on the Mercurial server.

Debug Flag::

  As the name suggest activating this option, triggers debug output of
  any Mercurial command execution. This is especially useful for
  trouble shooting your configuration.

Download Forest extension::

  Using one of the suggested values in the online help for this option
  you can get the forest extension to work with multiple repositories
  installed automatically. This is especially useful if you can not
  easily install the extension with the same mechanism you installed
  Mercurial itself e.g. if no native package for the extension is
  available.

In addition, the Mercurial plugin facilitates the tool installer from
Hudson that allows Run Command and Extract from *.zip/*.tar.gz based
installs similar to the JDK installs documented in details in
<<section-configure-jdk>>. The Ant and the Maven plugins installers
described in <<section-configure-ant>> and <<section-configure-maven>>
use the same installers and you can find more hints of its usage
there.

[[section-scm-hg-project]]
==== Project-specific Mercurial Configuration

Selecting Mercurial under the Source Code Management section will
display the configuration options shown in
<<fig-scm-hg-project-config>>.

[[fig-scm-hg-project-config]]
.Configuring Mercurial Source Control Information
image::figs/web/scm-hg-project-config.png[scale=75]

The section show in <<fig-scm-hg-project-config>> contains the
following options:

Mercurial Version::

  This drop down lets you choose from the configured Mercurial
  installations. In most cases the Default will be fine.  

Repository URL::

  Specify the URL of the project to build.

Branch::

  By default a branch named +default+ will be checked out for the
  project build. This input allows you to specify and therefore build
  any other branch.

Advanced - Modules::

  The advanced setting Modules allows you to specify a folder and its
  contents, known as module, within the repository to be the exclusive
  source for changes triggering a build.

Advanced - Clean Build::

  Activating the Clean Build option causes Mercurial to remove any
  untracked files prior to the build.

Advanced - Subdirectory::

  By default the repository is checked out into the
  workspace. Supplying a value in the Subdirectory option will cause
  the repository to be checked out into a subdirectory in the
  workspace.

Advanced - Forest Extension::

  This experimental features triggers the activation of the Mercurial
  forest extension, which will treat the workspace as the root of a
  forest.

Repository Browser::

  The default Auto option will cause the plugin to attempt to detect a
  web-based user interface to access the Mercurial
  repository. Selecting one of the supported repository browsers
  hgweb, bitbucket, googlecode, kilnhg and fisheye lets you provide a
  URL to the repository browser. With the URL specified the changes
  view of each build will have added links to the repository.

[[section-scm-hg-basic-config]]
==== Minimal Basic Mercurial Configuration

In order to build a project controlled in Mercurial you need to
install the Mercurial plugin and have a hg installation configured in
the global configuration.

In terms of project specific configuration you only need to specify
the public url of the repository.

[[section-scm-cvs]]
=== Configuring CVS

If your Hudson Jobs rely on CVS there is no plugin configuration
necessary, as the Hudson CVS Plugin and support for the
http://cvs.nongnu.org/[CVS system] is included as a part of the
default Hudson distribution.

[[section-scm-cvs-global]]
==== Global CVS Configuration

To configure CVS, find the CVS section in the Hudson Server
configuration screen as displayed in <<fig-scm-cvs-global-config>>.
From the Hudson start page, click on Manage Hudson, then click on
Configure System, and scroll down to the CVS section of this
configuration form.  If CVS is already installed on your Hudson server
and the cvs is available on the path, you do not need to configure a
CVS installation. The plugin will pick up the installed version.

[[fig-scm-cvs-global-config]]
.Global CVS Configuration
image::figs/web/scm-cvs-global-config.png[scale=75]

The CVS configuration section allows you to configure the following
properties:

cvs executable::
  If the cvs executable is not available on the PATH, you can
  configure an absolute path to it in this input field.

cvspass file::
  Specify the path to the .cvspass file that contains the user
  credentials.

Disable CVS compression::
  Activate this option to disable CVS compression.

[[section-scm-cvs-project]]
==== Project-specific CVS Configuration

Selecting CVS under the Source Code Management section will display
the configuration options shown in <<fig-scm-cvs-project-config>>.

.Configuring CVS Source Control Information
image::figs/web/scm-cvs-project-config-advanced.png[scale=75]

The section show in <<fig-scm-cvs-project-config>> and
<<fig-scm-cvs-project-config-advanced>> contain the following options:

CVSROOT::

  This is the CVSROOT parameter for your source. You would enter in
  the same information here that you would use if you were checking
  out source code use the CVS client.  The format for the URL is

----
<protocol>:<user>:<password>@<servername>:<serverpath>
----

Each component in the CVSROOT parameter 

protocol::

  The protocol defines the way the CVS client communicates to the
  repository. Supported protocols are +:local:+ for local or net file
  system level connection, +:pserver:+ as the standard unsecured
  protocol, +:ext:+, +:ssh:+ and +:extssh:+ for secure shell based
  connections and +:sspi:+ for Windows based access.

NOTE: Due to concurrency and additional load on the repository, we
recommend avoiding the local protocol for CI builds.  Using the local
protocol in Hudson often results in problems if too many clients are
trying to access a CVS repository at the same time.

WARNING: Please also keep in mind that the pserver protocol is
insecure.  If you storing sensitive data or code in a CVS repository,
avoid the pserver protocol and use ssh as an alternative.

user::

  Supply the user name for the client-server protocol used.

password::

  Specify the password when using the +:pserver:+ or +:sspi:+
  protocol.

servername::

  The server name of the repository server as reachable via the
  network. It can be a fully qualified server and domain name, a
  server name only or an IP number. The character +@+ is required at
  the beginning of the server name. 

serverpath::

  The path to the repository on the server prepended by +:+. The path
  itself can be either unix style like +/opt/data/cvsrepo+ or Windows
  style like +C:\cvs\repository+.

An example for a valid url with a module is shown below.

----
:pserver:anonymous@tortoisecvs.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/tortoisecvs
----

Module(s) and Branch::

  Here you can provide specific modules and specific branches to be
  checked out by Hudson. Multiple module can be specified using a
  space separated list and with a parameterized build job parameters
  can be used to specify branch or module.

CVS_RSH::

  If you are using CVS over SSH, you can specify options and
  parameters in this variable.

Use update::

  Hudson can be configured to do a full checkout on each build or to
  use cvs update. Selecting this option will tell Hudson to use update
  instead of performing a clean checkout. For most reasonably sized
  projects you should activate this option.

Repository browser::

  The default Auto option will cause the plugin to attempt to detect a
  web-based user interface to access the CVS repository. Selecting one
  of the supported repository browsers ViewCVS and FishEye lets you
  provide a URL to the repository browser.

Excluded Regions::

  If the module you are checking out contains some files that you need
  to exclude from triggering a build when changed, you can exclude
  regions by populating this field with the respective patterns.

[[chapter-ide-integration]]
== IDE Integration

The default way of interacting with Hudson is the web-based user
interface. In addition Hudson ships with web service interfaces, that
enable integration with others tools such as integrated development
environments.

=== Eclipse Integration

Hudson offers an intuitive set of Eclipse plugins which allow for
greater control and interaction with your Hudson instance. This
section covers some of these plugins and gives you an overview of how
to access some of the features that allow you to have immediate
insight into continuous builds.

=== The Hudson Jobs Eclipse View

To open up the Hudson Jobs view in Eclipse, go to Window -> Show View
-> Other... . Selecting this menu item will display the dialog shown
in <<fig-eclipse-open-hudson-jobs>>.


[[fig-eclipse-open-hudson-jobs]]
.Opening the Hudson Jobs View in Eclipse
image::figs/web/ide-eclipse-open-hudson-jobs.png[scale=75]

Once you've select this Hudson Jobs view, you should see a list of
jobs as shown in<<fig-eclipse-hudson-jobs>>. This is a list which is
retrieved directly from Hudson using Hudson REST services.  To refresh
the list of jobs, click on the refresh icon shown in the following
figure.

[[fig-eclipse-hudson-jobs]]
.Hudson Jobs View in Eclipse
image::figs/web/ide-eclipse-hudson-jobs.png[scale=75]

If your Eclipse instance is not yet connected to a Hudson server,
click on the blue sphere icon to the left of the refresh icon in the
previous figure. This icon will load the Subscribe to Build Job
Notifications dialog. To connect Eclipse to a new Hudson instance,
enter the URL of the Hudson server along with your user name and
password credentials.

=== View Hudson Projects from Eclipse

Once you've loaded a list of Hudson jobs in Eclipse, you can click on
one of these Build Jobs to view a detailed snapshot of the project
status and any associated builds.  <<fig-eclipse-matrix-project>>
shows the status of a build job from Sonatype's own Hudson
instance. In this dialog you can see that the job detail window
contains general information about the Job in Job Properties,
information about specific Job Builds in Build Properties and also
links to alternative configuration for Build Jobs. If you need to get
more information about the Job's workspace in order to trouble shoot a
build, you can also click on View job workspace. Clicking on this link
will load the project's workspace in a browser window as another
Eclipse tab.

[[fig-eclipse-matrix-project]]
.Viewing a Matrix Project from Eclipse
image::figs/web/ide-eclipse-matrix-project.png[scale=75]

There are two very useful ways in which you can view the results of a
build. They are viewing a build's JUnit test results, viewing the SCM
changes associated with a specific build, and viewing a build's
console output. Both of these views of a particular job are the main
ways in which you can understand and diagnose issues with continuous
integration builds.

To view a build job's JUnit test results, load the job detail page and
click on the Test Results link shown
in <<fig-eclipse-matrix-project>>. Clicking on this link will load the
view shown in <<fig-eclipse-junit-tests>>. From this view you can
navigate through the JUnit test results for a specific build job. This
level of visibility into the continuous integration machine gives you
insight into code-level issues happening on a remote build machine
without requiring you to exit out of Eclipse and fire up a web
browser.

[[fig-eclipse-junit-tests]]
.Viewing JUnit Test Reports from Eclipse
image::figs/web/ide-eclipse-junit-tests.png[scale=75]

To view a specific build's SCM changes. Load the project detail view
and click on the SCM Changes tab shown in
<<fig-eclipse-matrix-project>>. This particular view of a project
combines the changelog of every single build into an easily navigable
interface. From the view shown in <<fig-eclipse-scm-changes>> you can
see what code changes trigger individual builds and you can get a
sense for what activity and which committer are responsible for build
successes and failures.

[[fig-eclipse-scm-changes]]
.Viewing SCM Changes from Eclipse
image::figs/web/ide-eclipse-scm-changes.png[scale=75]

Viewing a specific build's console output is often the quickest way to
get to the bottom of a build failure. To open a build's console
output, select the project from the Hudson jobs view, select an
individual project build, and then click on the "Console Output" link
shown in <<fig-eclipse-matrix-project>>. Clicking on this link will
load the view shown in <<fig-eclipse-console-output>>.  This view
gives you the raw console output from a Hudson build.

=== Configuring Eclipse Hudson Notifications

Once you've connected Eclipse to Hudson, you can also configure the
tool to notify you of build failure events. <<fig-eclipse-notify>>
shows an Eclipse installation which has been configured to receive
notifications of specific build failures.  Eclipse will periodically
poll Hudson to check for build failures.
